<p class="h1">THE THIRD VOLUME.</p>

<h2><a name="chI" id="chI"></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="h3">AN OLD FRIEND.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">When</span> Spenser Tait took his seat at the breakfast
table, he cast a look around, according to custom, to
see that all was as orderly as he could wish. The
neatest and most methodical of men, he was positively
old maidish in his love of regularity and tidiness. His
valet, Dormer,&mdash;with him for over fifteen years,&mdash;had
been trained by such long service into the particular
ways of his master, and was almost as exacting as Tait
himself in the matter of domestic details. No woman
was permitted to penetrate into those chambers in
Earls Street, St. James&#39;; but had one been able to do
so, she could have found no fault with them, either on
the score of taste or of cleanliness. The shell of this
hermit crab was eloquent of the idiosyncrasies of its
tenant.</p>

<p class="indent">The main characteristic of the breakfast room was
one of severe simplicity. The carpet of green drappled
brown, the curtains to match, and the furniture of oak,
polished and dark. On the white cloth of the table an
appetizing breakfast was set out in silver and china,
and a vase of flowers showed that the little gentleman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id="page2"></a>[pg&nbsp;2]</span>
was not unmindful of the requirements of an
artistic temperament. Even the <i>Times</i>, carefully cut
and warmed, was neatly folded by the silver ringed
napkin, and Dormer, standing stiff and lean by his master&#39;s
chair, was calmly satisfied that no fault could be
found with his work. For the past fifteen years, save
on occasions of foreign travel, the same etiquette had
been observed, the same actions performed, for, like the
laws of the Medes and Persians, the habits of Tait were
fixed and determined.</p>

<p class="indent">He was a pleasant creature of thirty-four years,
small in stature, clean-shaven and brown-locked. His
plump little body was clothed in a well-brushed smoking
suit of maroon-colored cloth, his neat feet encased
in slippers of red morocco, and he scanned the room
through a gold-mounted pince nez. Neat and firm as
he was, women did not care for him in the least, and
he returned the compliment by heartily disliking the
female sex. Yet with men he was a great favorite,
and the members of his club liked to hear the sententious
speeches of this little man, delivered with point
and deliberation in the smoking room from eleven till
midnight. When the clock struck twelve he invariably
went to bed, and no persuasion or temptation could
induce him to break this excellent rule.</p>

<p class="indent">Dormer, a tall, thin man of Kent, who adored his
precise master, was equally as misogynistic as Tait,
and silent on all occasions save when spoken to. Then
he replied in dry monosyllables, and stood bolt upright
during such replies, in a military fashion, which
he had picked up many years before in the army.
Tait humored his oddities on account of his fidelity,
knowing that this ugly, rough-hewn specimen of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>[pg&nbsp;3]</span>
humanity was as true as steel, and entirely devoted
to his interests. Nowadays it is unusual to meet with
such equal appreciation between master and servant.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think, Dormer,&quot; said Tait, while the man ministered
to his wants, &quot;that you might call at Mudie&#39;s
this morning and get me a copy of the new novel, &#39;A
Whim of Fate,&#39; by John Parver. I heard last night
that it contained a description of Thorston.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very good, sir,&quot; replied Dormer, noting the name
in his pocketbook.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And take a seat for me at the Curtain Theater,
in the fifth row of the stalls, not too near the side.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Anything else, sir?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think not,&quot; said his master, taking a morsel of
toast. &quot;I am going down to Richmond by the twelve
o&#39;clock train to luncheon with Mr. Freak. Lay out
the serge suit.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Dormer saluted in a military fashion, and disappeared,
leaving Tait to skim the paper and finish his
breakfast. Methodical as ever, the little man first
read the leading articles, thence passed to the city
news, perused the general information, and wound up
with a glance at the advertisements. In such order
he ever proceeded, and never by any chance thought
of beginning with the advertisements and working
back to the leading article. Habit was everything
with Spenser Tait.</p>

<p class="indent">As usual, his day&#39;s programme was carefully sketched
out, and he knew what he was about to do with every
moment of his time from noon till midnight. But his
plans on this special day were upset at the outset, for
scarcely had he lighted his morning pipe than the door
was thrown open and a visitor was announced.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>[pg&nbsp;4]</span>
&quot;Mr. Larcher,&quot; said Dormer stiffly, and ushered in
a tall young man with a bright face and a breezy
manner.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hullo, little Tait!&quot; cried the newcomer, hastily
striding across the room; &quot;here I am again. Come
from wandering up and down the earth, sir, like a
certain person whom I need not mention.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dear me,&quot; said Tait, welcoming his guest with
prim kindliness, &quot;it is Claude Larcher. I am very glad
to see you, my dear fellow, and rather surprised; for
I assure you I thought you were at the Antipodes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have just returned from that quarter of the
globe. Yes! Landed at the docks yesterday from
one of the Shaw-Saville line. Had a capital passage
from New Zealand. Sea like a mill-pond from Wellington
Heads to the Lizard.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you had breakfast, Larcher?&quot; asked Tait,
touching the bell.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A trifle! A trifle! I could eat another. What
have you? Bacon and eggs, watercress, coffee, and
the best of bread and butter. Egad, Spenser, you
had the same victuals two years ago when I last called
here!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am a creature of habit, Claude,&quot; replied Tait
sententiously; and when Dormer made his appearance
gave grave directions for fresh coffee and another dish
of eggs and bacon.</p>

<p class="indent">Larcher drew in his chair, and with his elbows on
the table eyed the little man with friendly eyes. They
were old schoolfellows and fast friends, though a
greater contrast than that which existed between them
can scarcely be imagined. Tait, a prim, chilly misogynist;
Larcher, a hot-blooded, impetuous lover of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>[pg&nbsp;5]</span>
women. The one a stay-at-home, and a slave to habit;
the other a roaming engineer, careless and impulsive.
Yet by some vein of sympathy the pair, so unlike in
looks and temperament, were exceedingly friendly,
and always glad to meet when circumstance threw
them together. Such friendship, based on no logical
grounds, was a standing contradiction to the rule that
like draws to like.</p>

<p class="indent">It was scarcely to be expected that a well-favored mortal
like Larcher should share his friend&#39;s distaste for the
female sex. Far from disliking them, he sought them
on all possible occasions, oftentimes to his own disadvantage;
and was generally involved in some scrape
connected with a petticoat. Tait, who was the older
of the two by five years, vainly exhorted and warned
his friend against such follies, but as yet his arguments
had come to naught. At the age of thirty, Larcher
was still as inflammable, and answered all Tait&#39;s expostulations
with a laugh of scorn.</p>

<p class="indent">It was easy to dower this hero with all the perfections,
physical or mental, which lie within the scope of
imagination, but the truth must be told at whatever
cost. Claude was no Greek god, no prodigy of learning,
neither an Apollo for looks, nor an Admirable
Crichton for knowledge; he was simply a well-looking
young man, clean-limbed, clear-skinned, healthy, athletic,
and dauntless, such as can be found by the dozen
in England. Thews and sinews he had, but was no
Samson or Hercules, yet his strong frame and easy
grace won the heart of many a woman, while with his
own sex he passed for a true comrade, and a friend
worth having.</p>

<p class="indent">He was an engineer, and built bridges and railways
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>[pg&nbsp;6]</span>
in divers quarters of the globe, pioneering civilization,
as it were, in the most barbarous regions.</p>

<p class="indent">For the past ten years he had roamed all over the
world, and his adventures, begotten by a daring and
reckless spirit, were already sufficient to fill a volume.
Master of at least half a dozen tongues, he could find
his way from the tropics to the pole, and was equally
at home on the prairie as in Piccadilly. Indeed, he
preferred the former, for civilization was little to his
taste, and he was infinitely more at ease in Pekin than
London. North and South America, Africa, China,
India, he knew them all, and on this occasion had
returned from a prolonged sojourn in the Antipodes,
where he had been building bridges across rapid New
Zealand rivers.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, my friend,&quot; said he, addressing himself to
a second meal with a hearty appetite, &quot;I need not
ask how you are. The same prim, finnicking little
mortal as ever, I see. Five years have made no
difference in you, Spenser. You&#39;ve not married, I
suppose?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not I,&quot; returned Tait, with stormy disgust.
&quot;You know my views on the subject of matrimony.
You might go away for one hundred years and would
return to find me still a bachelor. But you,
Claude&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I&#39;m still in the market. I wasn&#39;t rich enough
for the New Zealand belles.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Eh! You have five hundred a year, independent
of your earnings as an engineer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is the use of setting up house on a thousand
a year all told,&quot; retorted Claude coolly; &quot;but the fact
is, despite my inflammability, which you are pleased to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>[pg&nbsp;7]</span>
reproach, I have not yet seen the woman I care to make
Mrs. Larcher.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps it is just as well for the woman,&quot; answered
Tait dryly. &quot;I don&#39;t think you are cut out for a
domestic life.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have had no experience of it, so I can&#39;t say,&quot; said
Larcher, a shade passing over his face. &quot;You must
not forget that I was left an orphan at five years of
age, Tait. If it had not been for old Hilliston, the
lawyer, who looked after me and my small fortune, I
don&#39;t know what would have become of me. All
things considering, I think I have turned out fairly
decent. I have worked hard at my profession, I have
not spent my substance in riotous living, and have
seen much more of life than most young men. All of
which is self-praise, and that we know being no recommendation,
give me another cup of coffee.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tait laughed and obeyed. &quot;What are you going to
do now?&quot; he demanded, after a pause; &quot;stay in town,
or make another dash for the wilds?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll be here for a few months, till something turns
up,&quot; said Larcher carelessly. &quot;I did very well out of
that Maori land business, and bought some land there
with the proceeds. I suppose I&#39;ll go and look up Mr.
Hilliston, see all the theaters, worry you, and hunt for
a wife.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shan&#39;t assist you in the last,&quot; retorted Tait,
testily. &quot;However, as you are here you must stay
with me for the day. What are your immediate
plans?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I wish to call at the club and see if there are
any letters! Then I am at your disposal, unless you
have a prior engagement.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>[pg&nbsp;8]</span>
&quot;I have a luncheon at Richmond, but I&#39;ll put
that off. It is not very important, and a wire will
arrange matters. Finish your breakfast while I
dress.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go, you effete dandy of an exhausted civilization.
I saw you looking at my rig-out, and I dare say it is
very bad. It has been packed away for the last five
years. However, you can take me to your tailor and
I&#39;ll get a fresh outfit. You won&#39;t walk down Bond
Street with me unless I assume a tall hat, patent leathers,
and a frock coat.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, by the way, would you like to go to the
Curtain Theater to-night?&quot; asked Tait, vouchsafing
no reply to this speech. &quot;They are playing a good
piece, and I sent for a seat for myself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You selfish little man; just send for two while
you&#39;re about it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;With pleasure,&quot; replied Tait, who permitted Larcher
more freedom of speech than he did any other
of his friends. &quot;I won&#39;t be more than ten minutes
dressing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very good! I&#39;ll smoke a pipe during your absence,
and see with what further fribbles you have adorned
your rooms. Then we&#39;ll go to the club, and afterward
to the tailor&#39;s. I don&#39;t suppose my letters will detain
me long.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In this Larcher was wrong, for his letters detained
him longer than he expected. This opened the way to
a new course of life, of which at that moment he knew
nothing. Laughing and jesting in his friend&#39;s rooms,
heart-whole and untrammeled, he little knew what
Fortune had in store for him on that fateful morning.
It is just as well that the future is hidden from men,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[pg&nbsp;9]</span>
else they would hardly go forward with so light a
step to face juries. Hitherto Larcher&#39;s life had been
all sunshine, but now darknesses were rising above
the horizon, and these letters, to which he so lightly
alluded, were the first warnings of the coming
storm.</p>

<h2><a name="chII" id="chII"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="h3">A MYSTERIOUS COMMUNICATION.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The Athenian Club</span> was the most up-to-date thing
of its kind in London. Although it had been established
over eight years it was as new as on the day of
its creation, and not only kept abreast of the times,
but in many instances went ahead of them. The
Athenians of old time were always crying out for
something new; and their prototypes of London, following
in their footsteps, formed a body of men who
were ever on the look-out for novelty. Hence the
name of this club, which adopted for its motto the
classic cry, &quot;Give us something new,&quot; and acted well
up to the saying. The Athenian Club was the pioneer
of everything.</p>

<p class="indent">It would take a long time to recount the vagaries
for which this coterie had been responsible. If one
more daring spirit than the rest invented a new thing
or reinstated on old one, his fellows followed like a
flock of intelligent sheep and wore the subject threadbare,
till some more startling theory initiated a new
movement. The opinion of the club took its color
from the prevailing &quot;fad&quot; of the hour, and indeed
many of the aforesaid &quot;fads&quot; were invented in its
smoke room. It should have been called &quot;The Ephemeral
Club,&quot; from the rapidity with which its fanciers
rose to popularity and vanished into obscurity.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[pg&nbsp;11]</span>
After all, such incessant novelty is rather fatiguing.
London is the most exhausting city in the world in
which to live. From all quarters of the globe news is
pouring in, every street is crowded with life and movement;
the latest ideas of civilization here ripen to completion.
It is impossible to escape from the contagion
of novelty; it is in the air. Information salutes one
at every turn; it pours from the mouths of men; it
thrusts itself before the eye in countless daily and
weekly newspapers; it clicks from every telegraph wire,
until the brain is wearied with the flood of ephemeral
knowledge. All this plethora of intellectual life was concentrated
in the narrow confines of the Athenian Club
House. No wonder its members complained of news.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is the prevailing passion with the Athenian
at present?&quot; asked Larcher as he stepped briskly
along Piccadilly beside Tait.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The New Literature!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Upon my word, I can hardly tell you,&quot; replied Tait,
after some cogitation. &quot;It is a kind of impressionist
school, I fancy. Those who profess to lead it insist
upon works having no plot, and no action, or no dramatic
situations. Their idea of a work is for a man and
woman&mdash;both vaguely denominated &#39;he&#39; and &#39;she&#39;&mdash;to
talk to one another through a few hundred pages.
Good Lord, how they do talk, and all about their own
feelings, their own woes, their own troubles, their own
infernal egotisms! The motto of &#39;The New Literature&#39;
should be &#39;Talk! talk! talk!&#39; for it consists of
nothing else.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why not adopt Hamlet&#39;s recitation,&quot; suggested
Larcher laughingly, &quot;&#39;Words! words! words!&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg&nbsp;12]</span>
&quot;Oh, &#39;The New Literature&#39; wants nothing from
the past! Not even a quotation,&quot; said Tait tartly.
&quot;Woman&mdash;the new woman&mdash;is greatly to the fore in
this latest fancy. She writes about neurotic members
of her own sex, and calls men bad names every other
page. The subjects mostly discussed in the modern
novel by the modern woman, are the regeneration of
the world by woman, the failure of the male to bridle
his appetites, and the beginning of the millennium
which will come when women get their own way.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Haven&#39;t they got their own way now?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should think so. I don&#39;t know what further
freedom they want. We live in a world of petticoats
nowadays. Women pervade everything like microbes.
And they are such worrying creatures,&quot; pursued Tait
plaintively, &quot;they don&#39;t take things calmly like men
do, but talk and rage and go into hysterics every other
minute. If this sort of thing goes on I shall retire
with Dormer to an uninhabited island.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is easily seen that you are not a friend to the
new movement,&quot; said Larcher, with a smile, &quot;but here
we are. Wait in the smoke room, like a good fellow,
while I see after my correspondence.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You will find me in the writing room,&quot; replied
Tait. &quot;I have lost my morning pipe, and do not
intend to smoke any more till after luncheon.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t believe you&#39;re a man, Tait, but a clockwork
figure wound up to act in the same manner at the
same moment. And you are such a horribly vulgar
piece of mechanism.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tait laughed, gratified by this tribute to his methodical
habits, so, leaving Larcher to see after his letters,
he vanished into the writing room. Here he wrote an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg&nbsp;13]</span>
apologetic telegram to his friend Freak, and sent it off
so that it might reach that gentleman before he started
for Richmond. Then he scribbled a few notes on
various trifling matters of business which called for
immediate attention, and having thus disposed of his
cares, ensconced himself in a comfortable armchair to
wait for Claude.</p>

<p class="indent">In a few minutes Larcher made his appearance with
a puzzled expression on his face, and two open letters
in his hand. Taking a seat close to that of Tait, he at
once began to explain that the news contained in the
letters was the cause of the expression aforesaid.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My other letters are nothing to speak of,&quot; said he,
when seated, &quot;but these two fairly puzzle me. Number
one is from Mr. Hilliston, asking me to call; the
other is from a Margaret Bezel, with a similar request.
Now I know Mr. Hilliston as guardian, lawyer, and
banker, but who is Margaret Bezel?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tait shook his wise little head. Well-informed as he
was in several matters, he had never heard of Margaret
Bezel.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She lives at Hampstead, I see,&quot; continued Claude,
referring to the letter. &quot;Clarence Cottage, Hunt
Lane. That is somewhere in the vicinity of Jack
Straw&#39;s Castle. I wonder who she is, and why she
wants to see me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have never heard of her?&quot; asked Tait
dubiously. He was never quite satisfied with Larcher&#39;s
connections with the weaker sex.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly not,&quot; replied the other, with some heat.
&quot;If I had I would assuredly remember so odd a name.
Bezel! Bezel! Something to do with a ring, isn&#39;t
it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg&nbsp;14]</span>
&quot;It might have something to do with a wedding
ring,&quot; said Tait, with a grim smile. &quot;The lady may
have matrimonial designs on you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bah! She may be a washerwoman for all you
know, or a wife, or a widow, or Heaven only knows
what. But that is not the queerest part of the affair,
for Mr. Hilliston&mdash;&mdash;But here, read the lady&#39;s letter
first, the gentleman&#39;s next, and tell me what you think
of them. Upon my word, I can make neither top nor
tail of the business!&quot;</p>

<p class="center">(<i>The First Letter.</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right">&quot;April 18, 1892.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>: Will you be so kind as to call and see
me at Clarence Cottage, Hunt Lane, Hampstead, as I
have an important communication to make to you
regarding your parents.</p>

<p class="center">&quot;Yours truly,</p>

<p class="right">&quot;<span class="smcap">Margaret Bezel</span>.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="center">(<i>The Second Letter.</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right">&quot;<span class="smcap">Lincoln&#39;s Inn Fields</span>, June 10, 1892.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<span class="smcap">Dear Claude</span>: Call and see me here as soon as
you arrive in town, and should you receive a communication
from one Margaret Bezel, bring it with you.
On no account see the lady before you have an interview
with me. This matter is more important than
you know of, and will be duly explained by me when
you call.</p>

<p class="center">&quot;Yours sincerely,</p>

<p class="right">&quot;<span class="smcap">Francis Hilliston</span>.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg&nbsp;15]</span>
Tait read these two letters carefully, pinched his
chin reflectively, and looked at Claude in a rather
anxious manner.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, sir,&quot; said the latter impatiently, &quot;what is
your opinion?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tait&#39;s opinion was given in one word, and that not
of the nicest meaning.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Blackmail.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Blackmail!&quot; repeated Larcher, taken aback, as
well he might be. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I may be wrong,&quot; said Tait apologetically, &quot;but
this is the only conclusion to which I can come. I
read the matter this way: Margaret Bezel knows
something about your parents, and wishes to reveal it
to you, possibly on condition that you pay her a sum
of money. Hilliston evidently knows that such is
her intention, and wishes to put you on your guard.
Hence he asks you to see him before you accept the
invitation of the lady.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;H&#39;m! This is feasible enough. But what possible
communication can this woman be likely to make to
me which would involve blackmail. My parents both
died when I was four years of age. She can&#39;t have any
evil to say of them after twenty-five years.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must question Hilliston as to that,&quot; replied
Tait, shrugging his shoulders. &quot;I think you ought
to see him this afternoon. He knows you are in town.
I suppose?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wrote from Wellington to tell him that I was
returning in the <i>Kailargatin</i>,&quot; said Claude, glancing at
the letter. &quot;He must have been informed by the
paper of her arrival yesterday, for this note is dated
the same day. To-day is the eleventh.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg&nbsp;16]</span>
&quot;But surely Hilliston knew you would call as soon
as you arrived?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He might be certain that I would do so within the
week, at all events,&quot; answered Larcher reflectively.
&quot;That is what makes his letter the more puzzling.
The matter must be very urgent when he demands an
immediate interview.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am certain he wishes to forestall this lady,&quot; said
Tait, picking up the letter of Margaret Bezel. &quot;She,
at all events, knows nothing of your movements, for
the note is dated the 10th of April, when you were in
New Zealand.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Humph! It is very odd, Tait.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is extremely odd, and too important to be
neglected. Call on Mr. Hilliston this afternoon, and
send him a wire now to make an appointment.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hope I am not going to have a bad quarter of an
hour,&quot; observed Claude, as he wrote out the telegram.
The mystery of the matter ruffled his usual serenity.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I sincerely trust you are not,&quot; replied the other,
touching the bell for the waiter; &quot;but I must say I do
not like the look of those two epistles.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The telegram was duly dispatched, and after a few
more conjectures as to the motive of the communications,
Larcher went upstairs to luncheon with his
friend. Halfway through the meal he was struck with
an idea.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Margaret Bezel must be old, Tait.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How do you know?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If she knows anything of my parents she must
have been their friend or servant, and as they died
twenty-five years ago she can be no chicken.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;True enough! But don&#39;t go out and meet your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg&nbsp;17]</span>
troubles halfway, Claude. It will be time enough to
worry should Hilliston give you bad news. By the
way, I suppose you&#39;ll stay with him to-night?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No doubt. He has bought a new house in Kensington
Gore, and wishes me to have a look at it. I
shall be glad to see his wife again. Dear old lady, she
has been a second mother to me, and he like a father.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And I like a brother,&quot; interposed Tait, laughing.
&quot;As a lonely orphan you have to depend upon public
charity for your relatives. But talking about new
houses, you must see mine.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What! Are you a householder?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A householder, not a landed proprietor,&quot; said Tait,
with pride. &quot;I have purchased an old Manor House
and a few acres at Thorston, about eight miles from
Eastbourne. You must come down and see it. I have
just had it furnished and put in order. A week or so
there will do you good, and give me much pleasure.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall be delighted to come,&quot; said Larcher hastily,
&quot;that is, if there is no troublesome business to detain
me in London.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, you will know shortly. After all, Hilliston
may give you good news, instead of bad.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bah! You don&#39;t believe that, Tait.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t indeed! But I am trying to comfort you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;After the fashion of Job&#39;s friends,&quot; retorted Claude
promptly. &quot;Well, you may be right, for I do not like
the look of things myself. However, I must take bad
fortune along with good. Hitherto all has gone well
with me, and I sincerely trust this letter from Margaret
Bezel is not a forerunner of trouble.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Should it be so, you will always have at least one
friend to stand by you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg&nbsp;18]</span>
&quot;Thank you, Tait,&quot; replied Larcher, grasping the
outstretched hand. &quot;Should the time come for testing
your friendship, I shall have no hesitation in putting
it to the proof. And the time is coming,&quot; added
he, tapping the pocket which held the letter, &quot;of that
I am certain.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What about our theater to-night?&quot; demanded Tait
dubiously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It all depends on my interview with Hilliston.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tait said nothing at the moment, and shortly afterward
they parted, Larcher to seek his guardian in
Lincoln&#39;s Inn Fields, Tait to return to his chambers.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Humph!&quot; said the latter thoughtfully, &quot;there will
be no theater for us to-night. I don&#39;t like the look of
things at all. The deuce take Margaret Bezel!&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="chIII" id="chIII"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="h3">THE REVELATION OF FRANCIS HILLISTON.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time popular imagination pictured
a lawyer as a cadaverous creature, arrayed in rusty
black, with bulging blue-bag, and dry forensic lore on
his tongue. So was the child of Themis represented
in endless Adelphia farces; and his moral nature, as
conceived by the ingenious playwright, was even less
inviting than his exterior. He was a scamp, a rogue,
a compiler of interminable bills, an exactor of the last
shilling, a legal <i>Shylock</i>, hard-fisted and avaricious.
To a great extent this type is a thing of the past, for
your latter-day lawyer is an alert, well-dressed personage,
social and amiable. Still he is looked on with
awe as a dispenser of justice,&mdash;very often of injustice,&mdash;and
not all the fine raiment in the world can rob
him of his ancient reputation: when he was a dread
being to the dwellers of Grub Street, who mostly had
the task of limning his portrait, and so impartial
revenge pictured him as above.</p>

<p class="indent">All of which preamble leads up to the fact that
Francis Hilliston was a lawyer of the new school,
despite his sixty and more years. In appearance he
was not unlike a farmer, and indeed owned a few
arable acres in Kent, where he played the rôle of a
modern Cincinnatus. There he affected rough clothing
and an interest in agricultural subjects, but in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg&nbsp;20]</span>
town in his Lincoln&#39;s Inn Fields&#39; office he was
solemnly arrayed in a frock coat with other garments
to match, and conveyed into his twinkling eyes an
expression of dignified learning. He was a different
man in London to what he was in Kent, and was a
kind of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde for moral transformations.
On this special occasion frock-coated
legality was uppermost.</p>

<p class="indent">Yet he unbent for a moment or so when receiving
Claude Larcher, for childless himself, the young man
was to him a very Absalom; and he loved him with an
affection truly paternal. No one can have the conduct
of a child up to the age of twenty&mdash;at which
period Claude made his <i>début</i> in the engineering world,
without feeling a tugging at the heart strings. Had
Larcher been indeed his son, and he a father in place
of a guardian, he could have scarcely received the
young man more warmly, or have welcomed him with
more heartfelt affection.</p>

<p class="indent">But the first outburst over, and Claude duly greeted
and seated in a convenient chair, Mr. Hilliston recurred
to his legal stiffness, and, with no smile on his lips, sat
eyeing his visitor. He had an awkward conversation
before him, and was mentally wondering as to the
best way of breaking the ice. Claude spared him the
trouble by at once plunging headlong into the subject
of Margaret Bezel and her mysterious letter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Here you are, sir,&quot; said he, handing it to his guardian.
&quot;I have brought the letter of this woman with
me as you wished, and I have also abstained from seeing
her in accordance with your desire.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Humph!&quot; muttered Hilliston, skimming the letter
with a legal eye, &quot;I thought she would write.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg&nbsp;21]</span>
&quot;Do you know her, sir?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes!&quot; said the other dryly. &quot;I know her.
But,&quot; he added after a thoughtful pause, &quot;I have not
set eyes on her for at least five-and-twenty years.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Twenty-five years,&quot; repeated Claude, thoughtful
in his turn. &quot;It was about that time I came into your
house.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hilliston looked up sharply, as though conceiving
that the remark was made with intention, but satisfied
that it was not from the absent expression in Larcher&#39;s
face, he resumed his perusal of the letter and commented
thereon.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you think of this communication,
Claude?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know what to think,&quot; replied the young
man promptly. &quot;I confess I am curious to know why
this woman wishes to see me. Who is she?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A widow lady with a small income.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Does she know anything of my family?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why do you ask that?&quot; demanded Hilliston
sharply, and, as it seemed to Claude, a trifle uneasily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, as I am a stranger to her, she cannot wish
to see me on any personal matter, sir. And as you
mention that you have not seen her for five-and-twenty
years, about which time my parents died, I naturally
thought&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That I had some object in asking you not to see
her?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are a man of experience now, Claude,&quot; said
Hilliston, with apparent irrelevance, &quot;and have been
all over the world. Consequently you know that life
is full of&mdash;trouble.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg&nbsp;22]</span>
&quot;I believe so; but hitherto no trouble has come my
way.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You might expect that it would come sooner or
later, Claude. It has come now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Indeed!&quot; said Larcher, in a joking tone. &quot;Am I
about to lose my small income of five hundred a year?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, that is safe enough!&quot; answered Hilliston
abruptly, rising to his feet. &quot;The trouble of which I
speak will not affect your material welfare. Indeed, if
you are a hardened man of the world, as you might be,
it need affect you very little in any case. You are not
responsible for the sins of a former generation, and as
you hardly remember your parents, cannot have any
sympathy with their worries.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I certainly remember very little of my parents,
sir,&quot; said Larcher, moved by the significance of this
speech. &quot;Yet I have a faint memory of two faces.
One a dark, handsome face, with kind eyes, the other
a beautiful, fair countenance.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your father and mother, Claude.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. So much I remember of them. But what
have they to do with Margaret Bezel&mdash;or Mrs. Bezel,
as I suppose she is called? Why does she want to see
me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To tell you a story which I prefer to relate myself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;About whom?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;About your parents.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But they are dead!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Hilliston, &quot;they are dead.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He walked about the room, opened a box, and took
out a roll of papers, yellow with age. These were
neatly tied up with red tape and inscribed &quot;The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg&nbsp;23]</span>
Larcher Affair.&quot; Placing them on the table before
him, Hilliston resumed his seat, and looked steadfastly
at his ward. Claude, vaguely aware that some unpleasant
communication was about to be made to him,
sat silently waiting the words of ill omen, and his
naturally fresh color faded to a dull white with apprehension.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have always loved you like a son, Claude,&quot; said
Hilliston solemnly, &quot;ever since you came to my
house, a tiny boy of five. It has been my aim to educate
you well, to advance your interests, to make you
happy, and above all,&quot; added the lawyer, lowering his
voice, &quot;to keep the contents of these papers secret
from you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Claude said nothing, though Hilliston paused to
enable him to speak, but sat waiting further explanation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thought the past was dead and buried,&quot; resumed
his guardian, in a low voice. &quot;So far as I can see it is
foolish to rake up old scandals&mdash;old crimes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Crimes!&quot; said Claude, rising involuntarily to his
feet.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Crimes,&quot; repeated Hilliston sadly. &quot;The time
has come when you must know the truth about your
parents. The woman who wrote this letter has been
silent for five-and-twenty years. Now, for some reason
with which I am unacquainted, she is determined to see
you and reveal all. A few months ago she called here
to tell me so. I implored her to keep silent, pointing
out that no good could come of acquainting you with
bygone evils; but she refused to listen to me, and left
this office with the full intention of finding you out, and
making her revelation.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg&nbsp;24]</span>
&quot;But I have been in New Zealand.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She did not know that, nor did I tell her,&quot; said
Hilliston grimly; &quot;in fact, I refused to give her your
address, but she is not the woman to be easily beaten,
as I well know. I guessed she would find out the
name of your club and write to you there, therefore
I sent that letter to you so as to counter-plot the
creature. I expected that you would find a letter from
her at your club on your arrival. I was right. Here
is the letter. She has succeeded so far, but I have
managed to checkmate her by obtaining the first interview
with you. Should you call on her,&mdash;and after
reading these papers I have little doubt but that you
will do so,&mdash;she will be able to tell you nothing new. I
cannot crush the viper, but at least I can draw its
fangs.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You speak hardly of this woman, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have reason to,&quot; said Hilliston quietly. &quot;But
for this woman your father would still be alive.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I mean that your father, George Larcher, was
murdered!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Murdered!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes! Murdered at Horriston, in Kent, in the year
1866.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Stunned by this information, which he was far from
expecting, Claude sank down in his chair with a
look of horror on his face, while Hilliston spoke
rapidly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have kept this secret all these years because I
did not want your young life to be shadowed by the
knowledge of your father&#39;s fate. But now Mrs. Bezel
intends to tell you the truth, and will give you a garbled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg&nbsp;25]</span>
version of the same, making herself out a martyr.
I must be beforehand with her, and I wish you to take
those papers, and read the account of the case which
ended in the acquittal of your mother.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My mother! Acquitted! Do you mean&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I mean that Mrs. Larcher was accused of the murder
of her husband, and was tried and acquitted.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Great Heavens! But she is now dead?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I say no more,&quot; said Hilliston, evading a direct
reply. &quot;You will know the truth when you read these
papers.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Larcher mechanically took the packet held out to
him, and placed it in his pocket. Then he rose to go.
A thousand questions were on the tip of his tongue,
but he dare not ask one. It would be better, he
thought, to learn the truth from the papers, in place
of hearing it from the lips of Francis Hilliston, who
might, for all he knew, give as garbled a version of the
affair as Mrs. Bezel. Hilliston guessed his thoughts,
and approved of the unspoken decision.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think you are right,&quot; he said, with deliberation;
&quot;it is best that you should learn the truth in that way.
When you have read those papers come and see me
about them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;One moment, sir! Who killed my father?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I cannot say! Your mother was suspected and
proved innocent. A friend of your father was also
suspected and&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And proved innocent?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No! He was never arrested&mdash;he was never tried.
He vanished on the night of the murder and has not
been heard of since. Now, I can tell you no more.
Go and read the papers, Claude.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[pg&nbsp;26]</span>
Larcher took up his hat and hurried toward the door
in a mechanical manner. There he paused.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Does Mrs. Bezel know the truth?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hilliston, arranging the papers on the table, looked
up with a face which had unexpectedly grown gray and
old.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes!&quot; he said quickly. &quot;I think Mrs. Bezel
knows the &#39;truth.&#39;&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="chIV" id="chIV"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="h3">WHAT OCCURRED AT HORRISTON.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">After</span> that fatal interview Claude went neither to
the house at Kensington Gore nor to the chambers of
his friend Tait. With the papers given to him by
Hilliston in his pocket, he repaired to a quiet hotel in
Jermyn Street, where he was well-known, and there
secured a bedroom for the night. A wire speedily
brought his luggage from the railway station, and thus
being settled for the moment, he proceeded to acquaint
himself with the tragedy of his parents&#39; lives.</p>

<p class="indent">It was some time before he could make up his mind
to read the papers, and, dreading the disagreeable
relation, he put off the perusal till such time as he
retired to bed. A note dispatched to the Club intimated
to Tait that the second seat at the Curtain
Theater would be unoccupied, and then Claude tried
to rid himself of distracting thoughts by a rapid
walk in the Park. So do men dally with the inevitable,
and vainly attempt to stay the march of Fate.</p>

<p class="indent">Dinner was a mere farce with the young man, for he
could neither eat nor drink, and afterward he dawdled
about the smoke room, putting off the reading of the
papers as long as he could. A superstitious feeling of
coming evil withheld him from immediately learning
the truth; and it was not until the clock struck ten
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[pg&nbsp;28]</span>
that he summoned up sufficient courage to repair to
his bedroom.</p>

<p class="indent">With the papers spread out on a small table, he sat
down at half-past ten, reading by the light of a single
candle. A second and a third were needed before he
arose from his chair, and the gray dawn was glimmering
through the window blinds as he laid down the
last sheet. Then his face was as gray as the light
spreading over street and house, for he knew that his
dead father had been foully murdered, and that his
dead mother had been morally, if not legally, guilty of
the crime. The tragedy&mdash;a strange mixture of the
sordid and the romantic&mdash;took place at Horriston, in
Kent, in the year 1866, and the following are the main
facts, as exhibited by the provincial press:</p>

<p class="indent">In the year 1860 George Larcher and his wife came
to settle at Horriston, attracted thereto by the romantic
beauty of the scenery and the cheerful society of
that rising watering-place. Since that time Horriston,
after a feeble struggle for supremacy, has succumbed
to powerful rivals, and is once more a sleepy little
provincial town, unknown to invalid or doctor. But
when Mr. and Mrs. Larcher settled there it was a
popular resort for visitors from all quarters of the
three kingdoms, and the young couple were extremely
liked by the gay society which filled the town. For
five years they lived there, but during the sixth
occurred the tragedy which slew the husband, and
placed the wife in the dock.</p>

<p class="indent">The antecedents of the pair were irreproachable in
every respect. He was a fairly rich man of thirty-five,
who, holding a commission in the army, had met with
his wife&mdash;then Miss Barker&mdash;at Cheltenham. She was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg&nbsp;29]</span>
a beautiful girl, fond of dress and gayety, the belle of
her native town, and the greatest flirt of the country
side. Handsome George Larcher, in all the bravery
of martial trappings, came like the young prince of the
fairy tale, and carried off the beauty from all rivals.
She, knowing him to be rich, seeing him to be handsome,
and aware that he was well-connected, accepted
his hand, and so they were married, to the great discomfiture
of many sighing swains. There was love on
his side at least, but whether Julia Barker returned
that passion in any great degree it is hard to say.
The provincial reporter hinted that a prior attachment
had engaged her heart, and though she married
Larcher for his money, and looks, and position, yet she
only truly loved one man&mdash;one Mark Jeringham, who
afterward figured in the tragedy at Horriston.</p>

<p class="indent">To all outward appearance Captain and Mrs. Larcher
were a pattern couple, and popular with military and
civil society. Then, in obedience to the wish of his
wife, George Larcher sold out, and within a few months
of their marriage they came to live at Horriston. Here
they took a house known as The Laurels, which
was perched on a cliff of moderate height, overlooking
the river Sarway; and proceeded to entertain the gay
society of the neighborhood. One son was born to
them a year after they took up their abode at The
Laurels, and he was five years of age when the tragedy
took place which caused the death of his parent.
Claude had no difficulty in recognizing himself as the
orphan so pathetically alluded to by the flowery provincial
reporter.</p>

<p class="indent">The household of George Larcher consisted of six
servants, among whom two were particularly interesting.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg&nbsp;30]</span>
The one was the captain&#39;s valet, Denis Bantry,
an Irish soldier in the same regiment as his master,
who had been bought out by Larcher when he took
leave of military glory. Attached to the captain by
many acts of kindness, Denis was absolutely devoted
to him, and was no unimportant personage in the new
home. The other servant was Mona Bantry, the sister
of Denis, a handsome, bright-eyed lass from County
Kerry, who acted as maid to Mrs. Larcher. The remaining
servants call for no special mention, but this
Irish couple must be particularly noted as having been
mixed up with the tragedy.</p>

<p class="indent">For some months all went well at The Laurels,
and it seemed as though the Larchers were devoted to
one another. But this was only outwardly, for the
character of Julia developed rapidly after marriage into
that of a vain, frivolous woman, eager of admiration,
extravagant as regards dress, and neglectful of the
infant son. Larcher, a thoroughly domesticated man,
greatly resented the attitude taken up by his wife, and
the resentment led to frequent quarrels. He was
annoyed by her frivolity and continuous absence from
home; while she began to dislike her grave husband,
who would have made her&mdash;as she expressed it&mdash;a mere
domestic drudge. But the pair managed to hoodwink
the world as to their real feelings to one another, and
it was only when the trial of Mrs. Larcher came on
that the truth was revealed. In all Kent there was no
more unhappy home than that at The Laurels.</p>

<p class="indent">To make matters worse, Mark Jeringham paid a visit
to Horriston, and having known Mrs. Larcher from
childhood, naturally enough became a frequent visitor.
He was everywhere at the heels of the former belle of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[pg&nbsp;31]</span>
Cheltenham, who encouraged him in his attentions.
Larcher remonstrated with his wife on her folly, but
she saucily refused to alter her line of conduct. But
for the scandal of the thing Larcher would have forbidden
Jeringham the house; and, to mark his disapprobation,
gave him the cold shoulder on every
occasion. Nevertheless, this inconvenient person persisted
in thrusting himself between husband and wife,
to the anger of the former and the delight of the latter.
The introduction of this third element only made
matters worse.</p>

<p class="indent">The house was divided into camps, for Mona supported
her mistress in her frivolity, and, indeed, seemed
herself to have an admiration for handsome Mark
Jeringham, who was very generous in money matters.
Denis, in whose eyes his master was perfect, hated the
interloper as much as Larcher, and loudly protested
against the attention of Mona and his mistress.
Another friend who supported Larcher was Francis
Hilliston, then a gay young lawyer of thirty-five, who
often paid a visit to Horriston. He also frequented
The Laurels, but was much disliked by Mrs. Larcher,
who greatly resented his loyal friendship for her husband.
Things were in this position on the 23d of
June, 1866, when events occurred which resulted in the
murder of Captain Larcher, the disappearance of Jeringham,
and the arrest of Mrs. Larcher on a charge of
murder.</p>

<p class="indent">A masked ball in fancy dress was to be given at the
Town Hall on that night, and hither Mrs. Larcher was
going as Mary, Queen of Scots, accompanied by Jeringham
in the character of Darnley. George Larcher
refused to be present, and went up to London on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg&nbsp;32]</span>
night in question, leaving his faithful friend Hilliston
to look after his matrimonial interests at the ball.
Before he left a terrible scene took place between himself
and his wife, in which he forbade her to go to the
dance, but she defied him, and said she would go without
his permission. Whereupon Larcher left the house
and went up to London, swearing that he would never
return until his wife asked his pardon and renounced
the friendship of Jeringham.</p>

<p class="indent">Now, here began the mystery which no one was able
to fathom. Mrs. Larcher went to the ball with Jeringham,
and having, as she said to Hilliston, who was
also at the ball, enjoyed herself greatly, returned home
at three in the morning. The next day she was ill in
bed, although she had left the Town Hall in perfect
health, and Mark Jeringham had disappeared. Larcher
was not seen in the neighborhood for five days,
and presumably was still in London; so during his
absence Mrs. Larcher kept her bed. Then his body,
considerably disfigured, was found at the mouth of the
river Sarway, some four miles down. Curious to state
it was clothed in a fancy dress similar to that worn by
Jeringham on the night of the ball.</p>

<p class="indent">On the discovery of the body public curiosity was
greatly excited, and a thousand rumors flew from
mouth to mouth. That a crime had been committed
no one doubted for a moment, as an examination
proved that George Larcher had been stabbed to the
heart by some slender, sharp instrument. The matter
passed into the hands of the police, and they paid a
visit to The Laurels for the purpose of seeing what
light Mrs. Larcher could throw on the matter. At
this awful period of her frivolous life Francis Hilliston
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[pg&nbsp;33]</span>
stood her friend, and it was he who interviewed the
officers of the law when they called.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Larcher was still in bed, and, under the doctor&#39;s
orders, refused to rise therefrom, or to receive
her visitors. She protested to Hilliston, who in his
turn reported her sayings to the police, that she knew
nothing about the matter. She had not seen her husband
since he left her on the 23d of June, and no
one was more astonished or horror-struck than she
at the news of his death. According to her story
she had left the ball at three o&#39;clock, and had driven to
The Laurels with Jeringham. He had parted from
her at the door of the house, and had walked back to
Horriston. His reason for not entering, and for not
using the carriage to return, was that he did not wish
to give color to the scandal as to the relations which
existed between them, which Mrs. Larcher vowed and
protested were purely platonic.</p>

<p class="indent">Furthermore, she asserted that her illness was
caused by a discovery which she had made on the
night of the ball: that Mona Bantry was about to
become a mother, and to all appearance she believed
that the father of the coming child was none other
than her husband. Far from thinking that he had
been murdered, she had been waiting for his return in
order to upbraid him for his profligacy, and to demand
a divorce. Mona Bantry had disappeared immediately
after the discovery of her ruin, and Mrs. Larcher professed
that she did not know where she was.</p>

<p class="indent">This story, which was feasible enough, satisfied the
police authorities for the moment, and they retired,
only to return three days later with a warrant for the
arrest of Mrs. Larcher. In the interval a dagger had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[pg&nbsp;34]</span>
been found in the grounds of The Laurels, on the
banks of the river, and, as it was stained with blood
and exactly fitted the wound, it was concluded that
with this weapon the crime had been committed.
Inquiry resulted in the information being obtained that
Mrs. Larcher, in her character of Mary, Queen of
Scots, had worn this dagger on the night of the ball.
Hence it was evident, so said the police, that she had
killed her husband.</p>

<p class="indent">The theory of the police was that Captain Larcher
had returned from London on the night of the ball,
and had witnessed the parting of his wife and Jeringham
at the door. Filled with jealous rage he had
upbraided his wife in the sitting room, the window of
which looked out on the cliff overhanging the river.
In a moment of fury she had doubtless snatched the
dagger from her girdle and stabbed him to the heart,
then, terrified at what she had done, had thrown the
body out of the window, trusting that the stream
would carry it away, and so conceal her crime. This
the river had done, for the body had been discovered
four miles down, where it had been carried by the current.
As to the dagger being in the grounds in place
of the room, the police, never at a loss for a theory,
suggested that Mrs. Larcher had stolen out of the
house, and had thrown the dagger over the bank
where it was subsequently discovered.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Larcher asserted her innocence, and reiterated
her statement that she had not seen her husband since
the day of the ball. He had not returned on that
night, as the servants could testify. The only domestics
who had not retired to bed when she returned at
three o&#39;clock were Mona and Denis. Of these the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[pg&nbsp;35]</span>
first had gone away to hide her shame, and all inquiries
and advertisements failed to find her. But at the
trial Denis&mdash;much broken down at the ruin of his
sister&mdash;swore that Captain Larcher had not returned
from London on that evening, and that Mrs. Larcher had
gone straight to the sitting room, where she first made
the discovery of Mona&#39;s iniquity, and then had afterward
retired to bed. Mrs. Larcher asserted that the
dagger had been lost by her at the ball, and she knew
not into whose hands it had fallen.</p>

<p class="indent">The trial, which took place at Canterbury, was a
nine days&#39; wonder, and opinions were divided as to
the guilt of the erring wife. One party held that she
had committed the crime in the manner stated by the
police, while the others asserted that Jeringham was
the criminal, and had disappeared in order to escape
the consequences of his guilt. &quot;Doubtless,&quot; said they,
&quot;he had been met by Larcher after leaving the house,
and had killed him during a quarrel.&quot; The use of the
dagger was accounted for by these wiseacres by a
belief that Mrs. Larcher had given it to Jeringham as
a love token when she parted from him at the door of
The Laurels.</p>

<p class="indent">The evidence of Denis, that he had been with or
near Mrs. Larcher till she retired to bed, and that the
captain had not set foot in the house on that evening,
turned the tide of evidence in favor of the unfortunate
woman. She was acquitted of the crime, and went to
London, but there died&mdash;as appeared from the newspapers&mdash;a
few weeks afterward, killed by anxiety and
shame.</p>

<p class="indent">The child Claude was taken charge of by Mr. Hilliston,
who had been a good friend to Mrs. Larcher
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[pg&nbsp;36]</span>
during her troubles, and so the matter faded from the
public mind.</p>

<p class="indent">What became of Jeringham no one ever knew. His
victim&mdash;as some supposed Larcher to be&mdash;was duly
buried in the Horriston Cemetery, but all the efforts
of the police failed to find the man who was morally,
if not legally, guilty of the crime. Denis also was
lost in the London crowd, and all those who had been
present at the tragedy at The Laurels were scattered
far and wide. New matters attracted the attention
of the fickle public, and the Larcher affair was
forgotten in due course.</p>

<p class="indent">The mystery was never solved. Who was guilty of
the crime? That question was never answered.
Some accused Mrs. Larcher despite her acquittal and
death. Others insisted that Jeringham was the criminal;
but no one could be certain of the truth. Hilliston,
seeing that Mr. and Mrs. Larcher were dead, that
Mona, Denis, and Jeringham had disappeared, wisely
kept the matter secret from Claude, deeming that it
would be folly to disturb the mind of the lad with an
insoluble riddle of so terrible a nature. So for five-and-twenty
years the matter had remained in abeyance.
Now it seemed as though it were about to be reopened
by Mrs. Bezel.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And who&mdash;&quot; asked Claude of himself, as he finished
this history in the gray dawn of the morning, &quot;who is
Mrs. Bezel?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">To say the least, he had a right to ask himself this
question, for it was curious that the name of Mrs.
Bezel was not even mentioned in connection with that
undiscovered crime of five-and-twenty years before.</p>

<h2><a name="chV" id="chV"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="h3">A STRANGE COINCIDENCE.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">In</span> spite of Tait&#39;s methodical habits, circumstances
beyond his control often occurred to upset them. On
the previous day the unexpected arrival of Claude had
altered his plans for the day, and after his return from
the theater on the same evening, he had&mdash;contrary to
his rule&mdash;passed the night in reading. The invaluable
Dormer had procured &quot;A Whim of Fate&quot; from Mudie&#39;s,
and Tait found it lying on the table in company with
biscuits and wine. Excited by the performance, he
did not feel inclined to retire at his usual hour of midnight,
and while sipping his wine, picked up the first
volume to while away the time till he should feel sleepy.</p>

<p class="indent">Alas! this novel, about which everyone in London
was talking, proved anything but soporific, and for the
whole of that night Tait sat in his comfortable chair
devouring the three volumes. The tale was one of
mystery, and until he learned the solution Tait, conventional
and incurious as he was, could not tear himself
from the fascination of the printed page. When
the riddle was read, when the criminal was hunted
down, when the bad were punished, and the good rewarded,
the dawn was already breaking in the east.
In his Jermyn Street hotel, Claude Larcher was rising,
stiff and tired, from the perusal of a tragedy in real
life; in his Earls Street chambers, Spenser Tait was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg&nbsp;38]</span>
closing the third volume of John Parver&#39;s work.
Each had passed a wakeful night, each had been fascinated
by the account of a crime, the one real, the
other fictional. So does Fate, whose designs no one
can presume to explain, duplicate our lives for the
gaining of her own ends.</p>

<p class="indent">Rather disgusted by his departure from the conventional,
and heartily blaming the too ingenious John
Parver for having caused such departure, Tait tumbled
hastily into bed, in order to snatch a few hours&#39; sleep.
Dormer, ignorant of his master&#39;s vigil, woke him
remorselessly at his usual hour, with the unexpected
intelligence that Mr. Larcher was waiting to see him
in the sitting room. From the telegram of the previous
night, and this early visit, Tait rightly concluded
that his friend was in trouble, so without waiting to
take his bath, he hurriedly slipped on a dressing gown,
and appeared sleepy and disheveled in the sitting room.
Larcher, who looked likewise dissipated, arose to his
feet as the little man entered, and they eyed one
another in astonishment, for the appearance of each
was totally at variance with his usual looks.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; said Tait interrogatively, &quot;I see you&#39;ve
been making a night of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I might say the same of you,&quot; replied Larcher
grimly; &quot;a more dissipated looking wretch I never
saw. Have you fallen into bad habits at your age?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That depends on what you call bad habits,
Claude. I have not been round the town, if that is
what you mean. But, seduced by the novel of a too
ingenious author, I have sat up all night devouring his
three volumes. Such a thing has not occurred with
me since I unfortunately tried to read myself to sleep
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[pg&nbsp;39]</span>
with &#39;Jane Eyre.&#39; Charlotte Brontë and John Parver
are both answerable for my white nights. But you,&quot;
continued Tait, surveying his friend in a quizzical
manner; &quot;am I to understand that&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are to understand that my night has been a
duplicate of your own,&quot; interrupted Larcher curtly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What! Have you been reading &#39;A Whim of
Fate&#39;?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, my friend, I have not. While you were devouring
fiction, I have been making myself acquainted with
a tragedy in real life.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Larcher thereupon savagely threw on the breakfast
table a roll of papers, and looked defiantly at his friend.
Tone and expression failed to elicit surprise.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh!&quot; said Tait reflectively, &quot;then Hilliston
gave you bad news, after all. I guessed he had from
your refusal to accompany me to the theater last
night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You guessed rightly. He gave me such news as I
never expected to hear. You will find it amply set
forth in those papers, which I have been reading all
night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dear me. I trust it is nothing serious. Has Mrs.
Bezel&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know anything about Mrs. Bezel,&quot; said
Larcher loudly. &quot;So far as she is concerned I am
as much in the dark as ever. But my parents&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What of them?&quot; interrupted Tait, uttering the
first thought which came into his mind. &quot;Are they
alive, after all?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No. They are dead, sure enough,&quot; muttered
Claude gloomily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In that case what can Mr. Hilliston or Mrs. Bezel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg&nbsp;40]</span>
have to say about them,&quot; demanded the other, looking
puzzled. &quot;No scandal about Queen Elizabeth, I
hope?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Confound it, man, don&#39;t be so flippant! I&#39;ve had
bad news, I tell you. My father,&quot;&mdash;here Larcher
gulped down his emotion with some difficulty&mdash;&quot;my
father was murdered!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Murdered!&quot; repeated Tait, looking aghast, as well
he might.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes! And my mother was accused of having murdered
him. There you have it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was some little time before Tait could face the
skeleton so unexpectedly produced from the Larcher
cupboard. Hitherto his acquaintance with crime had
been mainly derived from fiction after the style of John
Parver, or from the columns of the press; but now he
was brought face to face with a tragedy indirectly connected
with his dearest friend, and naturally enough
did not like the situation. Nevertheless, like the wise
little man he was, he made no comment on the truth so
suddenly blurted out, but pushed his friend into a comfortable
chair, and proposed breakfast.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Breakfast!&quot; cried Claude, clutching his hair; &quot;I
could not eat a morsel. Have you no feelings, you
little monster, to propose breakfast to me, after hearing
such hideous news. Why don&#39;t you give me sympathy,
and try and help me, instead of sitting at your
confounded rasher of bacon like a graven image.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll do all in my power later on,&quot; said Tait quietly;
&quot;but you are upset by this news, and no wonder. Try
and eat a little, then you can tell me all about it, and
I&#39;ll give you the best advice in my power.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Thus adjured, Claude drew in his chair, and managed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg&nbsp;41]</span>
to eat a morsel of toast and drink a cup of coffee,
after which he lighted his pipe, and smoked furiously,
while Tait, anxious that his friend should regain his
self-control, made a lengthened meal, and talked of
divers matters. Breakfast over, he also filled his
favorite pipe, and, drawing a chair close to that of
Larcher&#39;s, waited for an explanation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, Claude,&quot; said he, after a pause, during
which the other showed no disposition to speak, &quot;tell
me your trouble.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have told you,&quot; grumbled Larcher angrily; &quot;if
you want to know any more about it, read those
papers.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It would take too long, and, as it happens, I am
already tired with reading. Tell me about the affair
as shortly as possible, and then we can go through the
papers together. You say your father was murdered.
Who committed the crime?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No one knows! The criminal is still at large.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;After five-and-twenty years he is likely to remain
so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No!&quot;, cried Larcher vehemently, striking the
table; &quot;I&#39;ll hunt him down, and find him out, and put
a rope round his neck, so help me God!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You say your mother was accused of the crime,&quot;
said Tait, ignoring this outburst.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. But she was acquitted on the evidence of
my father&#39;s valet. Shortly afterward she died in London.
I don&#39;t wonder at it,&quot; said poor Claude distractedly;
&quot;the shame, the disgrace! If she survived she
was bitterly punished. I should like to see the man
who would dare to asperse her memory.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No one will do so,&quot; said Tait soothingly. &quot;Control
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg&nbsp;42]</span>
yourself, my dear fellow, and we will look into
this matter together. I have just been reading about
a crime, but I did not think I would be so soon concerned
in dealing with one.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You will help me, Tait? You will stand by me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear friend, can you ask? I am completely at
your service, and together we will do all in our power
to discover the murderer of your father and clear the
memory of your mother.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is clear. She was acquitted by the jury.
Don&#39;t you dare to&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t dare to say anything,&quot; interrupted Tait
impatiently. &quot;Do be reasonable, my good fellow.
So long as I am ignorant, I can say nothing. Tell me
the particulars and we may arrive at some conclusion.
Now then, give me a <i>précis</i> of the case.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Dominated by the superior calm of his friend, Claude
related the Larcher affair as succinctly as possible.
The details of the case had impressed themselves too
strongly on his brain for him to hesitate in the narration,
and, keeping his emotions well in hand, he managed
to give a fairly minute account of the tragedy
which had taken place at Horriston in the year 1866.</p>

<p class="indent">The effect on Tait was surprising. A look of blank
astonishment overspread his face as Larcher proceeded
with his story, and when it was finished he looked
anxiously at his friend. Apart from the details of the
case, he was deeply interested in the matter from
another point of view. Larcher waited to hear what
his friend thought of the case, but instead of commenting
thereon Tait both acted and spoke in an
apparently irrelevant manner.</p>

<p class="indent">Without a word he heard Claude to the end, then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>[pg&nbsp;43]</span>
rose from his seat, and walking to the other end of
the room returned with three volumes bound in red
cloth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This book is called &#39;A Whim of Fate,&#39;&quot; said he
placing the volumes at Larcher&#39;s elbow. &quot;Have you
read it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Confound it, what do you mean?&quot; burst out Claude,
with justifiable wrath. &quot;I tell you of a serious matter
which nearly concerns myself, and you prattle about
the last fashionable novel.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wait a minute,&quot; said Tait, laying a detaining hand
on his friend&#39;s coat sleeve. &quot;There is more method
in my madness than you give me credit for.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The story you tell me is most extraordinary. But
the information I am about to impart to you is more
extraordinary still. You say this crime at Horriston
was committed five-and-twenty years ago.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, you can see by the date of those newspapers.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It has very likely faded out of all memories.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course! I don&#39;t suppose anyone is now alive
who gives it a thought.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; said Tait, &quot;it is certainly curious.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is curious? Explain yourself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The story you tell me now was known to me last
night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Larcher looked at his friend in unconcealed surprise,
and promptly contradicted what seemed to be a foolish
assertion.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is impossible, Tait. I heard it only last night
myself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nevertheless, I read it last night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Read it last night!&quot; repeated Larcher skeptically.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[pg&nbsp;44]</span>
&quot;In this book,&quot; said Tait, laying his hand on the
novel.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you mean?&quot; demanded the other
impatiently.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I mean that John Parver, the author of this book,
has utilized the events which took place at Horriston
in 1866 for the purpose of writing a work of fiction.
The story you tell me is told in these pages, and your
family tragedy is the talk of literary London.&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="chVI" id="chVI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class="h3">TRUTH IS STRANGER THAN FICTION.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">This</span> astonishing statement was received by Claude
with a disbelieving smile; and so convinced was he of
its untruth that he affected anger at what he really
believed to be the flippancy of Tait&#39;s conduct.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is no doubt very amusing for you to ridicule my
story,&quot; said he, with cold dignity, &quot;but it is hardly the
act of a friend. Some matters are too serious to form
the subject of a jest; and this&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am not jesting,&quot; interrupted Tait eagerly. &quot;I
assure you that the tragedy which concerned your
parents forms the subject-matter of this novel. You
can read the book yourself, and so be convinced that I
am speaking the truth. The names and places are no
doubt fictional, but the whole story is narrated plainly
enough.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Larcher turned over the three volumes with a puzzled
expression. That a story with which he had only
become acquainted within the last twenty-four hours
should be printed in a book, and that the book itself
should be brought so speedily under his notice, seemed
to him quite inexplicable. The strangeness of the
occurrence paralyzed his will, and, contrary to his
usual self-dependence, he looked to Tait for guidance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you think of it?&quot; he asked irresolutely.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[pg&nbsp;46]</span>
&quot;Ah! That requires some consideration, my friend.
But before we go into the matter let us understand our
position toward each other. You believe this story of
your father&#39;s death?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly. Mr. Hilliston would not tell me an
untruth, and moreover this bundle of extracts from
provincial newspapers confirms his statement. I truly
believe that my father, George Larcher, was murdered
at Horriston in 1866 by&mdash;and there you have me&mdash;I
know not by whom. My own opinion is that Jeringham
is&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;One moment, Claude! Let us settle all preliminaries.
Are you resolved to take up this matter!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am! I must clear the memory of my mother, and
avenge the death of my father.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Would it not be better to let sleeping dogs lie?&quot;
suggested Tait, with some hesitation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do not think so,&quot; replied Claude quietly. &quot;I
am not a sentimental man, as you know; and my
nature is of too practical a kind to busy itself with
weaving ropes of sand. Yet in this instance I feel that
it is my duty to hunt down and punish the coward who
killed my father. When I find him, and punish him,
this ghost of &#39;66 will be laid aside; otherwise, it will
continue to haunt and torture me all my life.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But your business?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall lay aside my business till this matter is
settled to my satisfaction. As you know, I have a
private income, and am not compelled to work for
my daily bread. Moreover, the last four years have
brought me in plenty of money, so that I can afford to
indulge my fancy. And my fancy,&quot; added Claude in a
grim tone, &quot;is to dedicate the rest of my life to discovering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[pg&nbsp;47]</span>
the truth. Do you not approve of my
decision?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, and no,&quot; said Tait evasively. &quot;I think your
hunt for an undescribed criminal, whose crime dates
back twenty-five years, is rather a waste of time. All
clews must have disappeared. It seems hopeless for
you to think of solving the mystery. And if you do,&quot;
continued the little man earnestly, &quot;if you do, what
possible pleasure can you derive from such a solution?
Your father is a mere name to you, so filial love can
have nothing to do with the matter. Moreover, the
criminal may be dead&mdash;he may be&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have a thousand and one objections,&quot; said
Larcher impatiently, &quot;none of which have any weight
with me. I am in the hands of Fate. A factor has
entered into my life which has changed my future.
Knowing what I now know, I cannot rest until I learn
the truth. Do you know the story of Mozart?&quot; he
added abruptly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know several stories of Mozart. But this special
one I may not know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is told either of Mozart or Mendelssohn! I forget
which,&quot; pursued Larcher, half to himself. &quot;When
Mozart&mdash;let us say Mozart&mdash;was ill in bed, one of his
friends struck a discord on the piano, which required
what is technically known as a resolution for its completion.
The omission so tortured the sensitive ear of
the musician that, when his friend departed, he rose
from his bed and completed the discord in accordance
with musical theory. Till that was done he could not
rest.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And the point of your parable?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can you not see? This incomplete case of murder
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg&nbsp;48]</span>
is my discord. I must complete it by discovering the
criminal, and so round off the case, or submit to be
tortured by its hinted mystery all my life. It is not
filial love, it is not sentiment, it is not even curiosity,
it is simply a desire to complete a matter hitherto left
undone. Till I know the sequel to the Horriston
tragedy, I shall feel in a state of suspense&mdash;and suspense,&quot;
added Claude emphatically, &quot;is torture to
men of my temperament.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your reason is a trifle whimsical,&quot; said Tait, smiling
at the application of this musical theory to the
present instance, &quot;but I can understand your feelings.
Indeed, I feel the same way myself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why not? In reading &#39;A Whim of Fate,&#39; I could
not go to rest without knowing the end, and I feel
a like curiosity toward this tragedy of real life. I
shall not be content till I learn the truth. My feelings
are precisely the same as your own. Therefore,&quot;
pursued Tait, with emphasis, &quot;I propose to assist you
in your search. We will discuss the matter calmly,
and see what is best to be done. In spite of the lapse
of five-and-twenty years, who knows but what we
may lay hands on the murderer of your father, who is
no doubt now living in fancied security.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Unless he is dead.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who is making the objections now?&quot; said Tait,
smiling. &quot;Well, Claude, will you accept me as your
brother detective in this matter?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Willingly, and I thank you for this proof of your
friendship.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am afraid there is an element of selfishness mixed
up in my offer,&quot; said Tait, shrugging his shoulders.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[pg&nbsp;49]</span>
&quot;It is not every day that one can find an interesting
case like this to dissect. Excitement is the joy of life,
and I rather think we will be able to extract a great
deal from this investigation. Come! We now understand
one another.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Larcher grasped the hand held out to him, and
gratefully accepted the aid thus offered. From that
moment the two dedicated themselves to hunt down
the criminal at whose hands George Larcher had met
his death. It was as strange a compact as had ever
been made. Halting Nemesis, who had rested all
these years, once more resumed her stealthy progress,
and before her ran these two young men, as ministers
of her long-delayed revenge. This junction of unforeseen
circumstances savored of the dramatic.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The first thing to be done,&quot; said Tait, when the
compact was thus concluded, &quot;is to read both cases.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Both cases!&quot; repeated Claude curiously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes! You remember how Browning gives half a
dozen aspects of the same case in his &#39;Ring and the
Book.&#39; In a minor degree we benefit in the same
manner. There,&quot; said Tait, pointing to the roll of
newspapers, &quot;is the case from the real point of view,
and here, in these three volumes, we will find the same
case as considered in a fictional fashion by the novelist.
By reading both we may come to some conclusion
whence to start in our talk. Last night you read the
newspapers; I the novel. To-day we will reverse the
process. I will view the affair as set forth by the
provincial press, and you will devour the three
volumes of John Parver as I did last night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And afterward?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Eh! Who can say?&quot; replied Tait, shrugging his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[pg&nbsp;50]</span>
shoulders. Several sojourns in Paris had left their
trace in Gallic gestures, and possibly in Gallic flippancy.
&quot;We must know what foundation we have
before we build.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Claude nodded. He was of the same way of thinking
himself, and commented on his friend&#39;s speech
after his own fashion.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said he a trifle vindictively, &quot;we must build
our gallows stanch and strong. You can proceed
with your toilet, and afterward we will read novels and
newspapers, as you suggest. The result of our reading
must appear in our actions. I rather think,&quot; he
added slowly, &quot;that the result will be a visit to Mr.
Hilliston.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Without doubt. He was an eye-witness, and it is
always preferable to obtain evidence first hand.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then,&quot; said Claude reflectively, &quot;there is Mrs.
Bezel.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Quite so! The enterprising lady who started the
whole thing. Was she also an eye-witness?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can&#39;t say. Her name does not appear in the
newspapers.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Humph!&quot; muttered Tait, scratching his chin.
&quot;Nor in those three volumes can I find a character
likely to develop into Mrs. Bezel of Hampstead.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wonder who she can be,&quot; said Claude curiously,
&quot;or what she can have to do with the case.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That we must find out. Depend upon it, there is
more in this case than in newspapers or novel. We
must find out all about Mrs. Bezel, and,&quot; said Tait,
with emphasis, &quot;we must learn all that is to be
learned concerning John Parver.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who is John Parver?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[pg&nbsp;51]</span>
&quot;Who was the Man in the Iron Mask?&quot; replied
Tait, in a bantering tone.  &quot;I cannot say.  But whomsoever
he may be, he knows all about this case.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is that possibility, certainly,&quot; assented the
other smoothly, &quot;but I think it hardly likely.  A man of
to-day would not readily come across the account of a
tragedy occurring in a little known town twenty-five
years ago.  Do you know,&quot; he added, after a pause,
&quot;that it occurs to me that the publication of this
book, containing an account of the case, may have been
the cause which incited Mrs. Bezel to write the letter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thought so myself. Mrs. Bezel may think that
John Parver is a <i>nom de plume</i> assumed by Claude
Larcher.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Or another alternative. Mrs. Bezel may be John
Parver herself. It is the fashion nowadays for women
to write under the names of men.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was a few minutes&#39; silence, during which each
man was intent on his own thoughts.  Tait, whose
brain turned quicker than that of Larcher, was the first
to break the silence.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; said he, moving briskly toward his bedroom
door, &quot;before we can say or do anything we must
learn the facts of the case.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">As he vanished into his room Claude laid his hand
on the first of the three volumes.</p>

<h2><a name="chVII" id="chVII"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class="h3">&quot;LET SLEEPING DOGS LIE.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">On</span> the journey of life we sometimes come to a dead
stop. Obstacles arise which bar our further progress,
and circumstances, impossible to do away with, confront
us on all sides. We cannot go back, for in life
there is no retrogression; we cannot proceed, owing to
blocked paths, and so stand hopeless and powerless,
waiting for the word or action of Fate. She, unseen
but almighty deity, alone can remove the hindrance
which prevents our progress, and until she speaks or
acts, we can do nothing but wait. It is on such occasions
that we feel how truly we are the puppets of
some unknown power.</p>

<p class="indent">Francis Hilliston had arrived at some such stoppage.
Hitherto his keen brain, his strong will, his capability
for decisive action, had carried him onward from past
to present, through present to future. When obstacles
had arisen they had been easily swept away, and with
his own life in his hands, he was perfectly satisfied of
his power to mold it to his liking. Possibly Fate, who
is a somewhat jealous deity, felt angered at the egotistic
self-reliance of the man; for without warning she
brought him to a dead stop, then grimly waited to see
how his boasted cunning would outwit her. As she
probably foresaw, the man did nothing but await her
decision. It was the only thing he could do.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>[pg&nbsp;53]</span>
For five-and-twenty years the Horriston tragedy had
been unmentioned, unthought of; Hilliston deemed
that it was relegated to the category of unknown
crimes, and having in mind his friendship for the
parents, and his love for the son, was not unwilling
that it should be so. He did not wish Claude to know
of the matter, he was not desirous that he should come
in contact with Mrs. Bezel; and hitherto had managed
so well that neither contingency had eventuated. Congratulating
himself on his dexterity, he remained
lulled in fancied security, when Fate, observant of his
complacency, sent a bolt from the blue, and brought
him up short. Now, Hilliston, forced by circumstances
to tell the truth to Larcher, did not know what to do.
He could only wait for the fiat of the higher power.</p>

<p class="indent">Grimly satisfied that she had brought home his fault,
and had shown him his moral weakness, Fate made
the next move, and sent Larcher and his friend to
Lincoln&#39;s Inn Fields to again set Hilliston on his former
journey. The paralysis of will which had seized the
elder man did not extend to the younger; for Claude
arrived full of anxiety to begin the search for the
undiscovered criminal. The first result of his compact
with Tait was this visit to the lawyer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Claude Larcher; Spenser Tait,&quot; muttered Hilliston,
glancing at the cards brought in by his clerk. &quot;I
thought as much; the matter is out of my hands now.
Show the gentlemen in,&quot; he added sharply.</p>

<p class="indent">The clerk departed, and Hilliston walked quickly
to the window, where he stood biting his nails. All
geniality had vanished from his face; he looked older
than his years, and an unaccustomed frown wrinkled
his expansive forehead. A crisis had come which he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg&nbsp;54]</span>
knew not how to meet; so, after the fashion of men
when they feel thus helpless, he left the decision in
the hands of Fate. Which was precisely what Fate
wanted.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good-morning, Claude! Good-morning, Mr.
Tait!&quot; said Hilliston, welcoming the young men with
artificial enthusiasm. &quot;I expected to see you today.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Surely you did not expect to see me?&quot; said Tait,
in a silky tone, as he placed his hat on the table.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Indeed, I did! Where Damon is Phintias is sure to
be. That Claude&#39;s perusal of those papers would
result in your accompanying him to this office, I felt
sure. I was right. Here you are!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Hilliston affected a cheerfulness he was far from
feeling. With increasing age a distaste had come for
violent excitements, and with one of Claude&#39;s temperament
he knew that the chances were that the ensuing
quarter of an hour would be somewhat stirring. Contrary
to his expectations, however, Larcher was eager,
but calm, and Hilliston, assuring himself that the calmness
was genuine, began to hope that the interview
would pass off better than he expected. Still, none of
us like to reopen a disagreeable chapter of the book
of life, and this Mr. Hilliston, against his will and
inclination, was about to do.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, sir,&quot; said Claude, when they were all seated,
and the hush of expectancy was in the air, &quot;I have
read those papers.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Mr. Hilliston interrogatively; &quot;and
what do you think of the matter?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think it is a very black case.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are quite right, Claude. It is a very black
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[pg&nbsp;55]</span>
case indeed. I did all in my power to bring the
criminal to justice, but without success.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who is the criminal?&quot; asked Larcher, with a keen
glance at his guardian.</p>

<p class="indent">Hilliston shuffled his feet uneasily, by no means relishing
the directness of the question.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is a difficult question to answer,&quot; he said
slowly; &quot;in fact an impossible one. My suspicions
point to Jeringham.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">From this point Tait made a third in the conversation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is because Jeringham disappeared on the
night of the murder,&quot; he said leisurely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. I think that circumstance alone is very
suspicious.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He was never found again?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never. We advertised in all the papers; we
employed detectives, inquired privately, but all to no
result. The last person who saw Jeringham was Mrs.
Larcher. He parted from her at the door of The
Laurels, and vanished into the night. It still hides
him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you conclude from that, sir?&quot; asked
Claude, after a pause.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can only conclude one thing,&quot; replied Hilliston,
with great deliberation, &quot;that your father, suspicious of
Jeringham, returned on that night from London, and
saw the parting. The result is not difficult to foresee.
It is my own opinion that there were words between
the men, possibly a struggle, and that the matter
ended in the murder of your father by Jeringham.
Hence the discovery of the body thrown into the river,
hence the flight of the murderer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[pg&nbsp;56]</span>
&quot;Was this the generally received opinion at the
time?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. I can safely say that it was believed Jeringham
was guilty, and had fled to escape the consequences
of his crime.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In that case, how was it that Mrs. Larcher was
arrested?&quot; asked Tait skeptically.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You cannot have read the case carefully, to ask me
that,&quot; replied Hilliston sharply. &quot;She was arrested
on the evidence of the dagger. Without doubt the
crime was committed with the dagger, and as she had
worn it, the inference was drawn that she was the
guilty person. But she was acquitted, and left the
court&mdash;as the saying is&mdash;without a stain on her
character.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nevertheless she died, Mr. Hilliston.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shame killed her,&quot; said the lawyer sadly. &quot;She
was a foolish woman in many ways,&mdash;your pardon,
Claude, for so speaking,&mdash;but she was not the woman
to commit so foul a crime. Indeed, I believe she was
fondly attached to her husband till Jeringham came
between them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah!&quot; interposed Tait composedly, &quot;that is John
Parver&#39;s view.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;John Parver?&quot; repeated Hilliston, with well-bred
surprise. &quot;I do not know that name in connection
with the case.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nor do we know the name of Mrs. Bezel,&quot; said
Claude quickly.</p>

<p class="indent">Hilliston started, and looked at Claude as though he
would read his very soul. The inscrutability of the
young man&#39;s countenance baffled him, and he turned
off the remark with a dry laugh.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[pg&nbsp;57]</span>
&quot;With Mrs. Bezel we will deal hereafter,&quot; he said
shortly; &quot;but who is this John Parver!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is the author of a book called &#39;A Whim of
Fate.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A novel?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. A novel which embodies the whole of this
case.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is strange,&quot; said Hilliston quietly, &quot;but no
doubt the author has come across the details in some
old provincial journal, and made use of them. The
Larcher affair caused a great deal of talk at the time,
but it is certainly remarkable that a novelist should
have made use of it for fictional purposes after the
lapse of so many years. I must read the book. Just
note the name of it here, Mr. Tait, if you please.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tait did so, and Hilliston continued:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is my character in the book?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think so. Under the name of Michael Dene!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I trust the author has been flattering to me. By
the way, who does he say committed the crime?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Michael Dene.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hilliston went gray on the instant, as though a sudden
blow had been struck at his heart. Two pairs of
keen eyes were fixed on his face with some surprise,
and uneasy at the scrutiny, he strove to recover his
composure.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Upon my word,&quot; he said, with quivering lips, &quot;I
am infinitely obliged to John Parver for describing
me as a murderer. And what motive does he ascribe
to me, or rather to Michael Dene, for the committal of
the crime?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Love for the wife,&quot; said Tait, smiling.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Eh! That is rather the rôle of Jeringham, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[pg&nbsp;58]</span>
should say,&quot; replied Hilliston, the color coming back
to lips and cheek. &quot;I must read this novel, and if
possible discover the identity of the author.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, we will do that!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Claude!&quot; cried the lawyer, in astonishment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I and Tait. We intend to follow out this case to
the end.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is useless! Five-and-twenty years have elapsed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nevertheless, I am determined to hunt down the
murderer of my father,&quot; said Claude decisively.
&quot;Besides, we have two eye-witnesses to the tragedy.
Yourself and Mrs. Bezel.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah! Mrs. Bezel! I forgot her. Certainly, I will
do all in my power to help you, Claude. Your father
was my dearest friend, and I shall only be too glad to
avenge his fate. But if I could not do it at the
moment, how can I hope to do so now&mdash;after so long a
period has elapsed?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Leave that to us, sir. Tait and I will attend to
the active part of the business. All we ask you to do
is to give us such information as lies in your power.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will do that with pleasure,&quot; said Hilliston, who
by this time was thoroughly master of himself.
&quot;What is it you wish to know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We wish to know all about Mrs. Bezel. Who is
she? What has she to do with the case? Why is not
her name mentioned in these pages?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For answers to these questions you had better apply
to the lady herself. You have her address. Why not
call on her?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I intend to do so to-morrow.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The old man rose from his seat, and took a turn up
and down the room. Then he paused beside Claude,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[pg&nbsp;59]</span>
and laid a trembling hand on the young man&#39;s
shoulder.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have been a good friend to you, Claude.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have been my second father&mdash;my real father,&quot;
said Larcher gently. &quot;I shall never forget your
kindness. I would return it if I could.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then do so, by letting sleeping dogs lie.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you mean by that, Mr. Hilliston?&quot; asked
the other, with a subtle change in his tone.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Abandon this case. Do not call on Mrs. Bezel.
You can do no good by reopening the affair. It was
a mystery years ago, it is a mystery still; it will
remain a mystery till the end of time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not if I can help it. I am sorry to disoblige you,
sir, but my mind is made up. I am determined to find
out the truth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hilliston sighed, passed his hand across his forehead,
and returned to his seat, hopeless and baffled.
He was sufficiently acquainted with Claude&#39;s character
to know that he was not easily turned from
his purpose, and that his resolution to solve the mystery
would be resolutely carried out. Yet he made
one more attempt to bend the young man to his
will.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you are wise you will not call on Mrs. Bezel.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why not, sir?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It will give you great pain.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All my pain is past,&quot; replied Claude quickly.
&quot;I can suffer no more than I did when reading these
papers. I must call on Mrs. Bezel; I must know the
truth, and,&quot; added he significantly, &quot;I have your
promise to assist me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will do all in my power,&quot; answered Hilliston
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[pg&nbsp;60]</span>
wearily, &quot;but you do not know what are you doing.
I am older and more experienced than you, and I give
you my best advice. Do not see Mrs. Bezel, and leave
the Larcher affair alone.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The result of this well-meant advice was that Claude
called the next morning on Mrs. Bezel.</p>

<h2><a name="chVIII" id="chVIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="h3">BOTH SIDES OF THE QUESTION.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Man&#39;s</span> life has frequently been compared to a river.
In childhood it is a trickling thread, in youth a stream,
in manhood a majestic river, and finally in old age is
swallowed up in the ocean of death. A very pretty
parable, but somewhat stale. It is time that life was
indicated by a new metaphor. Let us therefore compare
the life of man to the ocean itself. Like the
ocean life has its calms and storms, its sullen rages,
its caressing moments; and like the ocean&mdash;for this
is the main point of the illustration&mdash;it has its profound
depths, containing a hundred secrets unknown
to the outer world. Francis Hilliston was like the
ocean: all knew the surface, few were acquainted with
the depths below.</p>

<p class="indent">A man who leads a double life need never feel dull.
He may be nervous, anxious, fearful lest his secret
should be discovered, but the constant vigilance
required to hide it preserves him from the curse of
ennui. He ever keeps the best side of his nature
uppermost; his smiles are for the world, his brow is
smoothed to lull suspicion. But to continue the simile
of the ocean: in the depths lie many terrible things
which never come to the surface; things which he
scarcely dare admit even to himself. Francis Hilliston
was one of these men.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[pg&nbsp;62]</span>
Everyone knew Hilliston of Lincoln&#39;s Inn Fields,
or thought they did, which is quite a different thing.
He was widely respected in the profession; he was
popular in society; hand and glove with prominent
and wealthy personages. His house at Kensington
Gore was richly furnished; his wife was handsome
and fashionable; he gave splendid entertainments, at
which none was more jocund than the host himself; he
was, outwardly, all that was prosperous and popular.
In his professional capacity he was the repository of
a thousand secrets, but of all these none was more
terrible than the one locked up in his own breast.</p>

<p class="indent">Long years of training, constant necessity, had
taught him how to control his emotions, to turn his
face into a mask of inscrutability; yet he succeeded
ill at times, as witness his interview with the two
young men. Not all his powers of self-repression
could keep his face from turning gray; nor prevent
the perspiration beading his brow; nor steady his
voice to well-bred indifference. Usually he succeeded
in masking his emotion; this time he had failed, and,
worst of all, he knew that he had failed.</p>

<p class="indent">It was not Claude that he feared, for the young man
was not of a suspicious nature; and even had he been
so, would certainly have scoffed at the idea of attributing
any evil to the one who had been to him a father.
Tait, silent, observant, and cynical, was the person to
be dreaded. Accustomed by his profession to read
faces, Hilliston had seen that the quiet little man was
possessed of one of those inquisitive penetrative
natures, which suspect all men, and from a look, a
gesture, a pause, can draw evidence to support any
suspicion they may entertain.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[pg&nbsp;63]</span>
Certainly Tait had no reason to distrust Hilliston
when he entered the room, but during the interview
he appeared dissatisfied with the lawyer&#39;s manner.
That Hilliston should attempt to dissuade Claude from
prosecuting a search for his father&#39;s murderer seemed
strange; but that he should betray such marked agitation
at the idea of such searching taking place was
stranger still. Altogether Tait left the office in a very
dissatisfied state of mind. Hilliston had sufficient
penetration to note this, and when left alone was at his
wit&#39;s end how to baffle the unwarrantable curiosity of
this intruder.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t mind Claude,&quot; he said, pacing up and down
the room, &quot;he has not sufficient brain power to find
out anything. I do not want him to know. But this
Tait is dangerous. He is one of those dogged creatures,
who puts his nose to the scent, and never
leaves the trail till the prey is captured. It is with
him I have to deal, not with Claude.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His agitation almost mastered him, and he hurriedly
took a small bottle from a drawer in his desk. Dropping
the contents of this into a glass of water, he
drank off the draught, and in a short space of time
regained his composure, in some measure. Then he
sat down to think, and plot, and plan how to baffle the
vigilance of Tait.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That infernal woman has done it all,&quot; he muttered
savagely; &quot;she has lighted the fire. Let us see how
she will put it out. But she cannot put it out,&quot; he
added, striking his forehead with his clenched fist; &quot;it
will blaze and burn. I shall burn with it unless&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was a strange smile on his lips, as an idea
entered his mind, and he glanced quickly at his watch.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[pg&nbsp;64]</span>
&quot;Four o&#39;clock. Claude can&#39;t possibly call on
Margaret to-day, so I have yet time to prepare her
for his visit. I must silence her at any cost. She
must hold her tongue or ruin us both. Great Heavens!
to think that she should break out like this after five-and-twenty
years. It is enough to drive me mad.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">By this time he had put on his gloves, and stretched
his hand toward his hat, which stood on a side table.
A glance in the glass showed him how old and gray
he looked, and the sight was so unexpected that he
started in dismay.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bah! I look as though I were going to fail,&quot; he
said to himself, &quot;but I must not fail. I dare not fail.
At sixty, rich, honored, respected, I am not going to
fall from the pedestal I have reached. I shall reassure
Claude. I shall baffle Tait. I shall silence Margaret.
The first move in the game is mine.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Calm, dignified, easy, he left his office, and stepped
into the brougham waiting at the door. To judge by
appearance, one would have thought him the most
respectable and upright man in London. No one knew
what lurked behind that benevolent expression. His
mask had fallen for the moment when Tait was present;
now it was on again, and he went forth to deceive the
world. Yet he had an uneasy consciousness that one
man at least guessed his real character.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never mind,&quot; he thought, as the footman closed
the door of the brougham, &quot;it will be strange if, with
my age and experience and reputation and money, I
cannot baffle him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He did not go direct home, as it was yet early, and
he had one or two things to do in connection with his
new task. First he drove to Tait&#39;s chambers, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[pg&nbsp;65]</span>
ascertained from the porter that the two young men
were within.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never mind sending up my name, I won&#39;t disturb
them,&quot; he said, when the porter requested his card.
&quot;I only wished to speak to Mr. Tait about a box at
the theater.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If it is the Lyceum you mean, sir, I have just got
two stalls for Mr. Tait.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah! I may see them there,&quot; replied Hilliston
negligently; and as he drove away reflected: &quot;Good!
They have not yet been to Hampstead; nor do they
intend to go to-night. Mr. Tait has yet to learn the
value of time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Driving through Piccadilly he stopped at a bookshop,
and with some difficulty, for the demand was
large, obtained a copy of &quot;A Whim of Fate.&quot; He
began to read it in the brougham, and skimmed its
pages so rapidly that by the time he reached Kensington
Gore he had nearly finished the first volume. He
did not recognize himself in the character of Michael
Dene, and became more convinced than ever that the
coincidence of the Larcher affair forming the plot of a
novel, was due to the author&#39;s reading the case in
some old provincial newspaper. On every page it
betrayed that, to him, the story was hearsay.</p>

<p class="indent">Fortunately Mrs. Hilliston was driving in the Park,
so the lawyer shut himself up in his library, and went
on reading the story. He did not see his wife till
dinner, which took place at eight o&#39;clock, and then
descended in his ordinary clothes, looking ill and pale.
Something he had read in the novel had startled him
more than he cared to confess&mdash;even to himself.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must excuse my dress, Louise,&quot; he said, on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>[pg&nbsp;66]</span>
taking his seat, &quot;but I have been so engrossed with a
novel that I did not hear the dressing bell.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It has not had a pleasant effect on you,&quot; replied
his wife, smiling; &quot;you do not look at all well.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am not well,&quot; said Hilliston, who merely trifled
with his food; &quot;you must excuse me going with you to
the Lamberts&#39; to-night, as I think I shall call in and see
my doctor.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you so bad as all that?&quot; questioned Mrs.
Hilliston anxiously. &quot;Why not send for Dr.
Bland?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I prefer going to see him, Louise. You will probably
not be back till three in the morning, so I will go
to bed immediately on my return. Have no fear, my
dear, it is only a trifling indisposition.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">After these plain statements it was rather strange
that Hilliston, in place of driving to Dr. Bland&#39;s, who
lived in Hill Street, should direct the cab, which he
picked up by the Park railings, to drive to Hampstead.</p>

<h2><a name="chIX" id="chIX"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p class="h3">MRS. BEZEL.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">One</span> cannot always judge by appearances either as
regards human beings or houses. Mr. Hilliston was
one excellent illustration of this rule; Clarence Cottage
was another. It was in a narrow and crooked lane
trending downward to the right, at the summit of
Fitzjohn&#39;s Avenue; an unpretentious two-story building,
divided from the public thoroughfare by a well-cultivated
garden. Therein grew thyme and lavender,
marigolds and pansies; for the owner of the
cottage loved those homely flowers, and daily gazed
at them from the bow-window wherein her couch was
placed.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Bezel never walked in her garden, for the all-sufficient
reason that she was a helpless paralytic, and
had not used her limbs for over ten years. Still a
moderately young woman of forty-five, she possessed
the remains of great beauty, ravaged by years of anxiety
and mental trouble. Those passing along the lane
usually saw her pale face at the window, and pitied the
sufferings written in every line; sufferings which were
apparent even to a casual glance. Noting the homely
garden, the mean-looking dwelling, the anxious expression
of the invalid, they deemed her to be some poor
sickly creature, the scapegoat of nature and the world,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[pg&nbsp;68]</span>
who had sought this secluded spot in order to hide her
troubles. This view was not entirely correct.</p>

<p class="indent">She was in ill-health, it is true; she dwelt in a small
house certainly; and the anxious expression was seldom
absent from her face. But she was in easy circumstances,
untroubled by pecuniary worries, and the
interior of the cottage was furnished with a magnificence
more suggestive of Park Lane than of Hampstead.
The outward aspect of the house, like that of
Mr. Hilliston, was a lie.</p>

<p class="indent">Her sitting room resembled the boudoir of some
Mayfair beauty. The curtains were of silk, the carpet
velvet pile, the walls were adorned with costly pictures,
and every corner of the small apartment was filled
with sumptuous furniture. All that art could contribute,
all that affection could suggest, were confined
in the tiny space, and had Mrs. Bezel possessed the
mines of Golconda she could not have been more
luxuriously lodged. The house was a gem of its kind,
perfect and splendid.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Bezel took little interest in these material
comforts. Her life was passed between a couch in the
bow-window, a well-cushioned chair by the fire, and a
downy bed in the next room. She had little appetite
and did not enjoy her food; mental anxiety prevented
her interesting herself in the splendors around her;
and the only pleasure she took was her dreary journey
in a Bath-chair when the weather permitted. Then, as
she inhaled the fresh breeze blowing across the Heath,
she gazed with longing eyes at London, almost hidden
under its foggy veil, far below, and always returned
with reluctance to the familiar splendors of her narrow
dwelling. Fortune had given her much, but by way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[pg&nbsp;69]</span>
of compensation had deprived her of the two things
she most desired&mdash;of health and of love.</p>

<p class="indent">Even on this warm June evening a fire burned in
the grate, for Mrs. Bezel was a chilly creature, who
shrunk at the least breath of wind. According to
custom, she had left the window couch at seven
o&#39;clock, and had taken her simple meal while seated
in her large chair to the right of the fireplace. After
dinner she took up a novel which was placed on a
small table at her elbow, and tried to read; but her
attention was not fixed on the book, and gradually it
fell from her hands, while she gazed idly at the fire.</p>

<p class="indent">What she saw therein Heaven only knows. We all
have our moments of retrospection, and can picture
the past in the burning coals. Some even picture the
future, but there was none for this woman. She was
old, weary, diseased, worn-out, and therefore saw in
the fire only the shadows of past years. Faces looked
out of the flaming valleys, scenes arranged themselves
in the red confusion; but among them all there was
always one face, one scene, which never vanished as
did the others. This special face, this particular
scene, were fixed, immovable, cruel, and insistent.</p>

<p class="indent">The chime of the clock striking half-past nine roused
her from her reverie, and she again addressed herself
to the novel with a sigh. Tortured by her own
thoughts, Mrs. Bezel was not accustomed to retire
before midnight, and there were nearly three hours to
be got through before that time. Her life was as
dreary, and weary, and heart-breaking as that of
Mariana in the Moated Grange.</p>

<p class="indent">The tread of a firm footfall in the distance roused
her attention, and she looked expectantly toward the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>[pg&nbsp;70]</span>
door, which faced her chair. The newcomer passed
up the narrow garden path, entered the house, and,
after a pause in the hall, presented himself in the
sitting room. Mrs. Bezel knew who it was before the
door opened; for standing on the threshold was the
man with the face she had lately pictured amid the
burning coals. Francis Hilliston and the woman who
called herself Mrs. Bezel looked steadily at one
another, but no sign of welcome passed between them.
He was the first to break the awkward silence.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How are you this evening, Margaret?&quot; he asked,
advancing toward her; &quot;better, I hope. There is
more color in your cheeks, more brightness in your
eyes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am the same as ever,&quot; she replied coldly, while
he drew a chair close to the fire, and stretched out his
hands to the blaze. &quot;Why have you come here at
this hour?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To see you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No doubt! But with what purpose?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hilliston pinched his nether lip between finger and
thumb, frowning the while at the fire. Whatever had
been, there was now no love between this woman and
himself. But on no occasion had he noted so hostile
a tone in her voice. He was aware that a duel of
words and brains was about to ensue, and, knowing
his antagonist, he took the button off his foil. There
was no need for fine speaking or veiled hints in this
conversation. It was advisable that all should be
plain and straightforward, for they knew each other
too well to wear their masks when alone. Under these
circumstances he spoke the truth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think you can guess my errand,&quot; he said suavely.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>[pg&nbsp;71]</span>
&quot;It concerns the letter you wrote to Claude
Larcher.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thought as much! And what more have you to
say in connection with that affair?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have merely to inform you that the man whom
you desire to see is in London, and will no doubt
answer your kind invitation in person.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Bezel stretched out her hand and selected a
letter from the little pile on her table.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you will look at that,&quot; she said coldly, &quot;you
will see that Claude intends to call on me at three
o&#39;clock to-morrow.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Taking the letter in silence, Hilliston turned frightfully
pale, and the perspiration stood in large beads on
his forehead. He expected some such appointment
to be made, yet the evidence in his hand startled him
all the same. The promptitude of action spoke volumes
to one of his acute perceptions. To defend his
good name would require all his skill and experience,
for he had to do with men of action, who acted as
quickly as they thought. The duel would be more
equal than he had thought.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you still determined to tell all,&quot; he said in a
low tone, crushing the paper up in his hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The monosyllable was uttered in so icy a manner
that Hilliston lost his temper completely. Before this
woman there was no need for him to retain his smiling
mask, and in a frenzy of rage he hurried into rapid
speech, frantic and unconsidered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, you would ruin me!&quot; he cried, springing to
his feet; &quot;you would drag up those follies of &#39;66,
and make London too hot to hold me! Have I not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[pg&nbsp;72]</span>
implored, threatened, beseeched, commanded&mdash;done
everything in my power to make you hold your peace?
Miserable woman, would you drag the man you love
down to&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The man I loved you mean,&quot; responded Mrs.
Bezel, in nowise moved by this torrent of abuse.
&quot;Pray do not be theatrical, Francis. You know me
well enough to be aware that when my mind is made
up I am not easily moved. A man of your brains,&quot; she
added scornfully, &quot;should know that loss of temper is
but the prelude to defeat.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Recognizing the truth of this remark, Hilliston
resumed his seat, and subdued his anger. Only the
look of hatred in his eyes betrayed his real feelings;
otherwise he was calm, suave, and self-controlled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you weighed the cost of your action?&quot; he
demanded quietly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. It means ruin to us both. But the loss is
yours, not mine. Helpless and deserted, life has no
further charms for me, but you, Mr. Hilliston, doubtless
feel differently.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Margaret,&quot; he said entreatingly, &quot;why do you
speak like this? What harm have I done you that&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What harm!&quot; she interrupted fiercely. &quot;Have you
not ruined me, have you not deserted me, have you
not robbed me of all that I loved? My life has been
one long agony, and you are to blame for it all. Not
a word,&quot; she continued imperiously.  &quot;I shall speak.
I insist upon your knowing the truth!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go on,&quot; he said sullenly; &quot;I listen.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I loved you once, Francis. I loved you to my own
cost. For your sake I lost everything&mdash;position,
home, respect, and love. And you&mdash;what did you do?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>[pg&nbsp;73]</span>
Hilliston looked round the room, and shrugged his
shoulders. Look and gesture were so eloquent that
she commented on them at once.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you think I valued this splendor? I know well
enough that you gave me all material comforts. But
I wanted more than this. I wanted love.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You had it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aye! I had the passion such as you call love. Did
it endure? You know well that it did not. So long
as I was healthy and handsome and bright your attentions
continued, but when I was reduced to this state,
ten years ago, what did you do? Left me to marry
another woman.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was not my fault,&quot; he muttered uneasily; &quot;my
affairs were involved, and, as my wife had money, I
was forced to marry her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you did marry her, and no doubt neglect her
as you do me. Is Mrs. Hilliston any happier in her
splendid house at Kensington Gore than I in this
miserable cottage? I think not. I waited and waited,
hoping your love would return. It did not; so I took
my own course&mdash;revenge!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And so wrote to Claude Larcher!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. Listen to me. I wrote the first letter on
the impulse of the moment. I had been reading a
book called &#39;A Whim of Fate,&#39; which contained&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know! I know! I read it myself this evening.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then you know that someone else is possessed of
your secret. Who is John Parver?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know. I intend to find out. Meanwhile
I am waiting to hear the conclusion of your story.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Bezel drew a long breath, and continued:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The book, which contained an account of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[pg&nbsp;74]</span>
tragedy at Horriston, brought the fact so visibly
before me that I wrote on the impulse telling you
that I wished to see Claude, and reveal all. You
came and implored and threatened. Then my impulse
became a fixed determination. I saw how I
could punish you for your neglect, and so persisted
in my scheme. I wrote to Claude, and he is coming
here to-morrow.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you intend to tell him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So much of the death of his father as I know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must not&mdash;you dare not,&quot; said Hilliston, with
dry lips. &quot;It means ruin!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To you, not to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Impossible,&quot; he said curtly. &quot;Our relations are
too close for one to fall without the other.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So you think,&quot; rejoined Mrs. Bezel coolly; &quot;but
I know how to protect myself. And of one thing you
may be assured, I will say nothing against you. All
I intend to do is to tell him of his father&#39;s death.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He knows it already.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes! Did you think I was not going to be beforehand
with you,&quot; sneered Hilliston triumphantly. &quot;I
guessed your intention when you wrote me that letter,
and when Claude arrived in town I saw him before he
could call here. I did not intend to tell him of the
matter till your action forced me to do so. He has
read all the papers in connection with his father&#39;s
death, and intends to hunt down the murderer. Now,
do you see what you have done?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Apparently the brutal plainness of this speech
strongly affected Mrs. Bezel. It seemed as though she
had not comprehended till that moment what might be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>[pg&nbsp;75]</span>
the result of her actions. Now an abyss opened at her
feet, and she felt a qualm of fear.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nevertheless, I intend to go on now that I have
begun,&quot; she said gloomily. &quot;I will answer any questions
Claude may ask me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You will put him in possession of a clew.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is not improbable; but, as I said, life has no
charms for me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You don&#39;t think of my sufferings,&quot; said Hilliston
bitterly, rising to his feet.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did you think of mine during all these lonely
years?&quot; she retorted, with a sneer. &quot;I shall punish
you, as you punished me. There is such a thing as
justice in this world.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I warn you that I shall protect myself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is your lookout. But I will show you this
mercy, as I said before. That nothing will be told by
me of your connection with this affair. As to myself,
I will act as I think best.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You will tell him who you are?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; I will tell him my real name.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then I am lost!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Surely not,&quot; she rejoined scornfully. &quot;Francis
Hilliston is old enough in villainy and experience to
protect himself against a mere boy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is not Claude I fear, but his friend, Spenser
Tait. He is the dangerous person. But enough of
this,&quot; added Hilliston, striking the table imperiously.
&quot;I forbid you to indulge in these follies. You know I
have a means whereby to compel your obedience.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is your possession of that means that has turned
me against you,&quot; she retorted dauntlessly. &quot;If you
give me back my&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>[pg&nbsp;76]</span>
&quot;Margaret! Not a word more! Let things remain
as they are.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have said what I intend to do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hilliston ground his teeth. He knew that nothing
he could say or do would shake the determination of
this woman. He had already experienced her resolute
will, and not even the means of which he spoke would
shake her immovability. There was nothing more but
to retire and protect himself as best he could. At
all events, she promised to remain neutral so far as he
was concerned. That was something gained. Before
leaving the house, however, he made one final effort to
force her to his will.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will not give you any more money.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t care, Francis. This cottage and its contents
are settled on me. A sale of this furniture will
produce sufficient money to last my life. I can&#39;t live
long now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will deny all your statements.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do so!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will have you declared insane and shut up in an
asylum.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Bezel laughed scornfully, and pointed toward
the door.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If that is all you have to say you had better go,&quot;
she said jeeringly. &quot;You know well enough that
you cannot harm me without jeopardizing your own
position.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They looked at one another fiercely, each trying to
outstare the other. Hilliston&#39;s eyes were the first to
fall, and he hastily turned toward the door.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So be it,&quot; he said, with his hand on the knob;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[pg&nbsp;77]</span>
&quot;you want war. You shall have it. See Claude, tell
him all. I can defend myself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">On leaving the house a few minutes later, he paused
irresolutely by the gate and looked back.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If I could only find the paper,&quot; he muttered, &quot;she
could do nothing. As it is&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He made a gesture of despair and plunged into the
darkness.</p>

<h2><a name="chX" id="chX"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p class="h3">A FEW FACTS CONNECTED WITH THE CASE.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">When</span> the two young men left Lincoln&#39;s Inn Fields
after the momentous interview with Hilliston, they
walked on in silence for some distance, each busied
with his own thoughts. Like most solitaries, Tait had
a habit of speaking aloud, and, unmindful of the presence
of Claude, he stopped short at the gate of the
New Law Courts to give vent to his feelings.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is decidedly suspicious,&quot; he said in a low tone,
&quot;and quite inexplicable.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; asked Claude
irritably, whereupon Tait became aware that he was
not alone, but nevertheless showed no disposition to
balk the question.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was thinking of Mr. Hilliston,&quot; he returned
quietly. &quot;I am not at all satisfied with his conduct.
He is hostile to us, Claude.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hostile? Impossible! He is doing all in his
power to help us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So it appears,&quot; answered Tait dryly. &quot;Nevertheless
I think that he intends to thwart us in our plans&mdash;if
he can.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now you are talking nonsense,&quot; said Claude, as
they resumed their walk. &quot;Why, he first brought the
case under my notice.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And why? Because he wanted to be beforehand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>[pg&nbsp;79]</span>
with Mrs. Bezel. If he had not told she would have
done so, and naturally enough he wished to be first in
the field.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I can&#39;t think ill of him,&quot; protested Larcher.
&quot;He has been a second father to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No doubt! There is such a thing as remorse.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Remorse? You are mad!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not at all. I am suspicious. We will discuss
Mr. Hilliston later on, when I will give you my reasons
for speaking thus. Meanwhile he has decided to play
a game against us!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nonsense! He has no motive.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pardon me. I think he has, but what it is I am
unable to say&mdash;as yet. However, he will make two
moves in the game within the next twenty-four
hours.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Indeed,&quot; said Claude ironically, &quot;perhaps you
can tell me what those two moves will be.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly,&quot; answered Tait serenely. &quot;As to the
first, he will call at my rooms to find out if we have
gone to see Mrs. Bezel to-night, and&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why at your rooms?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because he thinks you are staying with me. And,
moreover, knowing that we are acting together, he
knows your movements will coincide with mine.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah! And the second move?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He will write you a letter asking you to stay with
him at Kensington Gore.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t see what there is suspicious about that,&quot;
said Claude petulantly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know you don&#39;t. But it is my belief that he is
afraid of your investigations in this case, and wishes to
keep you under his eye.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[pg&nbsp;80]</span>
&quot;But good Heavens, man! he advised me to pursue
the matter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;On the contrary, he advised you to let sleeping
dogs lie.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So he did,&quot; cried Claude, with a sudden recollection
of the interview. &quot;But why? What harm can
my investigations do to him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah! That is a difficult question to answer,&quot; said
Tait reflectingly. &quot;To my mind they will show that
Hilliston was not the friend of your father he pretended
to be.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But according to those papers he acted like a
friend throughout.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, according to those papers.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Larcher faced round suddenly, struck by the significance
of the remark. He was a clever young man, but
could not see clearly before him, and honest himself,
was far from suspecting dishonesty in others. Instead
of agreeing with Tait in his estimate of Hilliston, he
vehemently defended the lawyer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must not speak like that, Tait,&quot; he said
angrily. &quot;Mr. Hilliston is an honest man, and has
been like a father to me. I owe all to him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps you do,&quot; retorted Tait significantly.
&quot;However, we need not quarrel over the matter. I
am content to wait, and will bet you five pounds that
the inquiry is made to-night, and the letter is sent
to-morrow.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Larcher did not accept the bet thus confidently
offered, but walked on stiffly with his head in the air.
He was seriously annoyed with Tait for daring to cast
an imputation on the character of a man to whom he
owed all. Never could he bring himself to believe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>[pg&nbsp;81]</span>
that Hilliston intended him evil, and deemed that the
lawyer, despite his manifest reluctance, would help
him by all the means in his power to discover the
assassin.</p>

<p class="indent">Nevertheless, Tait proved to be in the right. As
the two young men passed down the stairs on their
way to the theater&mdash;whence Tait insisted on taking
Claude with a view of distracting his mind&mdash;they were
met by the porter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Beg pardon, sir,&quot; addressing himself to Tait, &quot;but
a gentleman called some time ago and asked for you
and Mr. Larcher.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who was he? Why did you not show him up?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He would not give his name, sir, and did not wish
to come up. He only asked if you had a box for the
theater, and when I said you had stalls, drove off.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah! Can you describe his appearance?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not very tall, sir. Clean shaven, with white hair
and a red face. Looked like a country gentleman,
sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you! that will do,&quot; replied Tait quietly,
and left the house with Claude.</p>

<p class="indent">For a few minutes he enjoyed his companion&#39;s
astonishment at this proof of Hilliston&#39;s double-dealing,
and it was not till they were in the cab that he spoke.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; he said, smiling, &quot;was I not right when
I said that he would make the first move?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are right so far,&quot; muttered Claude, who
looked ill at ease, &quot;but I cannot bring myself to suspect
my guardian.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You want another proof, perhaps. Well, we will
wait for your invitation to Kensington Gore.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Claude shook his head, and seemed so indisposed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>[pg&nbsp;82]</span>
talk that Tait judged it wise to humor his silence.
The young man&#39;s thoughts were anything but pleasant.
He had been accustomed to look up to Hilliston as the
model of an English gentleman, honest, honorable,
upright, and noble. If, then, this suspicion of Tait&#39;s
should prove correct,&mdash;and the last act of Hilliston
certainly gave color to it,&mdash;where was he to find honest
and honorable men? If Hilliston proved false, then
Claude felt he could no longer trust the human race.
Still he fought against the supposition, and secretly
hoped that the second prophecy of his friend would
not be fulfilled.</p>

<p class="indent">Alas, for his hopes! At eleven the next morning,
while they were discussing the situation, a letter was
delivered to Claude by special messenger. It proved
to be from Hilliston, and contained a warm invitation
for Larcher to take up his abode at the Kensington
Gore house. &quot;As you may only be in London for a
short period, my dear Claude,&quot; wrote his guardian,
&quot;my wife and I must see as much of you as possible.&quot;
With a bitter smile Claude tossed the letter
across to Tait.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You see I was right,&quot; said the latter, for the second
time, after skimming the note. &quot;Mr. Hilliston is
playing a double game. He wishes to keep you under
his eye, thinking that, as you trust him, you will keep
him informed as to your doings, so that being forewarned
he may be forearmed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you really think he is my enemy, Tait?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am really not prepared to say,&quot; replied the little
man, with some hesitation. &quot;His behavior of yesterday
struck me as suspicious. He seemed unnecessarily
agitated, and moreover urged you not to see Mrs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>[pg&nbsp;83]</span>
Bezel. Perhaps he thinks she will tell you too much.
Taking all these facts into consideration I cannot help
thinking that Hilliston is asking you to his house for
some motive in connection with our search.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But he showed me the papers.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know that, but as I told you yesterday it was
Hobson&#39;s choice with him. If he hadn&#39;t imparted the
information, Mrs. Bezel would have done so. Of two
evils he chose the least, and by showing you the papers
proved to all outward appearance that he was your firm
friend. Should you bring any charge against him, he
will meet it by the very argument you have just made
use of.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good Heavens!&quot; groaned Claude, in despair, &quot;is
everybody as treacherous as you think him to be.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A good number of people are,&quot; replied Tait
suavely. &quot;A long residence in London does not
strengthen one&#39;s belief in human nature. It is a city
of wild beasts,&mdash;of wolves and foxes,&mdash;who rend and
betray for the gaining of their own ends. If Hilliston
is what I believe him to be, we must do our best to
baffle him; and so you must continue to be his friend.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How can I, if he wishes to betray me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, you are so unsophisticated, Claude,&quot; said the
hardened man of the world; &quot;you betray your feelings
too plainly. In this city it is worse than madness to
wear your heart on your sleeve. If you are convinced
that Hilliston bears you ill&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am not convinced. I can&#39;t believe any man
would be so base.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, bah, that is a want of experience,&quot; retorted
Tait, raising his eyebrows; &quot;I&#39;ll pick you out a dozen
of my decent friends who are as base or baser than I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[pg&nbsp;84]</span>
believe them to be. Respectability is all a question of
concealment nowadays, and it must be confessed that
your guardian wears his mask very prettily.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But do you think he is&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never mind what I think,&quot; interrupted Tait
impatiently. &quot;Hilliston may turn out to be an angel,
after all. But his conduct of yesterday and this morning
appears to be suspicious, and in dealing with the
matters we have in hand it is as well to be careful.
Keep your faith in Hilliston if it assists you to continue
the friendship. He must suspect nothing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you then wish me to accept this invitation?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No. Why go into the lion&#39;s den? Write and
thank him and&mdash;decline.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have no excuse.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Indeed! Then I will provide you with one. You
are engaged to stay with me at Thorston for a month.
By the end of that time you will know sufficient of
Hilliston to decide for yourself as to the wisdom of
accepting or declining his invitation.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But if we go to Thorston we cannot prosecute our
inquiries.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, we can. I tell you that book, which contains
the story of your father&#39;s murder, also contains a
description of Thorston. I recognize every scene.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; repeated Tait sharply, &quot;can&#39;t you see?
The author of that book must either live at Thorston
or have stayed a few months there. Else he could not
have described the village so accurately. We must
make inquiries about him there, and should we be
fortunate enough to discover him, we must extract his
secret.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[pg&nbsp;85]</span>
&quot;What secret?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Upon my word, Claude, you are either stupid or
cunning. Why, find out where he got his material
from. That may put us on the right track. Now,
write to Hilliston, and then go up to Hampstead and
find out what Mrs. Bezel has to say.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Won&#39;t you come, too?&quot; said Claude, going to the
writing desk.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No. I have my own business to attend to.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is it connected with our enterprise?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should think so. It is my intention to call on
the firm who published &#39;A Whim of Fate,&#39; and find
out all I can concerning the author. When you return
from Mrs. Bezel we will compare notes, and on what
information we obtain will depend our future movements.&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="chXI" id="chXI"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<p class="h3">A STARTLING DISCOVERY.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">In</span> one of his novels Balzac makes the pertinent
remark that &quot;It is impossible for man to understand
the heart of woman, seeing that her Creator himself
does not understand it.&quot; These are not the precise
words, but the sentiment is the same. And who,
indeed, can understand a woman&#39;s heart; who can
aver that he has a complete comprehension of her
character? Very young men lay claim to such knowledge,
but as they grow older, and the vanity of
youth gives way to the modesty begotten by experience,
they no longer pretend to such omniscience, and
humbly admit their inability to solve the riddle of
femininity. Had the Sphinx proposed such an enigma
to &OElig;dipus he would not have been able to guess it,
and so, meeting the fate of other victims, would have
deprived Thebes of a king and Sophicles of a tragedy.</p>

<p class="indent">Yet, if we bear in mind that women work rather
from impulse than from motive, we may arrive at some
knowledge of the organ in question. If a woman is
impulsive, and most women are, she acts directly on
those impulses; and so startles men by paradoxical
actions. As a rule, the male intellect has logical
reasons wherefrom it deduces motives upon which to
act. Not so with women. They obey the impulse of
the moment, reckless of the consequence to themselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[pg&nbsp;87]</span>
or to anyone else. Consequently, it is impossible to
foretell how a woman will act in a given circumstance,
but it may be asserted that she will obey the latest
thought in her mind. Even from this point of view,
the feminine mind is still a riddle; but one which is
more capable of explanation.</p>

<p class="indent">For example, Mrs. Bezel read &quot;A Whim of Fate,&quot;
and thus, after five-and-twenty years, the Horriston
tragedy was freshly impressed on her brain.
Seized with remorse, terrified by the memory of the
crime, she, acting on the impulse, wrote to Hilliston
stating that she intended to see Claude Larcher and
reveal all. The dismay of the lawyer at this mad proposal,
and his steady opposition thereto, turned what
was originally a mere whim into a fixed idea. She saw
a way of punishing the man for the withdrawal of his
love ten years before, when she lost her beauty and
became paralyzed. Delighted at learning that she had
still some power to wound him, she persisted in her
project, and so wrote the letter to Larcher, which he
received the day after his arrival in London.</p>

<p class="indent">To baffle Hilliston, and prevent him from intercepting
the letter, she was obliged to use all her wits, and
so hit on the idea of learning the name of the young
man&#39;s club. How she managed to obtain it is best
known to herself; but Hilliston, never dreaming of
this pertinacity, was unable to thwart her schemes,
and, beyond writing to Claude, telling him to call,
could do nothing. Had he guessed that she would
address her invitation to the club, he might have called
and obtained it in the character of Larcher&#39;s guardian;
but, knowing her helpless condition, the thought that it
might be there never entered his mind. So the letter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>[pg&nbsp;88]</span>
arrived, was duly answered, and Claude was coming
to-day at three o&#39;clock to hear what Mrs. Bezel had to
say.</p>

<p class="indent">The visit, though due to her own action, was a source
of considerable anxiety; for she was not at all certain
of what she would say. It was impossible to tell all
without inculpating Hilliston, and this, for reasons of
her own, Mrs. Bezel was unwilling to do. All her talk
of the previous night had been so much rodomontade
to frighten the man she hated, but she was too well
aware of her dependent position to think of doing him
an injury. Her impulse had led her into deep water,
as she knew instinctively.</p>

<p class="indent">She was a woman who had lived every moment of
her life, but now, stretched on a bed of sickness, she
missed her former triumphs and excitements. This
visit promised a great deal of amusement, and the use
of much diplomacy, therefore she was unwilling to
abandon her plans. At the same time she determined
to give the young man as little information as she
possibly could. It would not be through her agency
that the mask would be torn from Hilliston&#39;s face.
She was resolved on that point.</p>

<p class="indent">Yet the matter, starting originally from an impulse,
had now gone too far for her to draw back. Claude
had seen the papers, and therefrom must have guessed
that she desired to impart certain information with
regard to the crime which had cost him a father. Mrs.
Bezel therefore compromised the matter, and settled
in her own mind to tell him half the truth, or, at all
events, only sufficient to interest him without aiding
him. Had she been a man, and had taken this decision,
all would have gone well, but being a woman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[pg&nbsp;89]</span>
she reckoned without her impulse, and it betrayed
her.</p>

<p class="indent">Moreover, she had a revelation to make which
would effectively tie Larcher&#39;s hands should he learn
too much; but this she did not intend to make unless
driven into a corner. She was in that corner before
the interview was finished, though she little expected
to get there. Hilliston, clever as he was, could not
understand her present actions; she did not understand
them herself, else she would not have ventured
to receive Claude Larcher.</p>

<p class="indent">He duly arrived at three o&#39;clock, and Mrs. Bezel
glanced approvingly at his stalwart figure and handsome
face. Claude had one of those sympathetic, yet
manly, natures, to which women are instinctively drawn
by the law of sex, and Mrs. Bezel proved no exception
to this rule. She was too thoroughly a woman not to
relish masculine society, and, despite her perplexity,
was glad she had sent the invitation, if only for the sake
of talking to this splendid looking young man. There
was another reason, which she revealed in a moment
of impulse. But that was later on.</p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile Claude, seated by her couch in the window,
was wondering who she was, and why she had
sought this interview. He was certainly aware that
she had some information to impart concerning the
fate of his parents, but as he had not seen her name in
the papers containing the account of the case, he was
at a loss to fix her identity. His doubts were soon set
at rest. Mrs. Bezel was a more prominent actor in
the Horriston tragedy than he had any idea of.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You were doubtless astonished to get my letter,&quot;
said Mrs. Bezel, when the first greetings were over,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>[pg&nbsp;90]</span>
&quot;especially as you do not remember your parents, and
my name is also unknown to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Were you a friend of my parents, madam?&quot; asked
Claude, too anxious for information to reply directly
to her remark.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. I&mdash;I knew them. That is, I lived at Horriston,&quot;
stammered Mrs. Bezel, passing a handkerchief
across her dry lips.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You lived at Horriston? At the time of the
murder?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Bezel nodded; she was not yet sufficiently self-controlled
for speech.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In that case,&quot; continued Claude eagerly, &quot;you
must know all the details of the crime.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Only those that were reported in the papers.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Still you must be acquainted with those concerned
in the tragedy. With my father, with Jeringham, Denis
Bantry, with Mona, his sister.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Mrs. Bezel calmly; &quot;I knew them
all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you any idea who committed the crime?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not the slightest.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you must have some suspicions?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes! But they may be wrong. I believe that
Mr. Jeringham had something to do with it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh!&quot; said Claude, remembering Hilliston&#39;s opinion,
&quot;some believe him to be guilty.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I cannot say for certain,&quot; replied Mrs. Bezel, shaking
her head. &quot;The flight of Mr. Jeringham certainly
showed that he had something to conceal.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What kind of a man was Mr. Jeringham?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tall and fair. Amiable as a rule, but liable to
violent passions.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>[pg&nbsp;91]</span>
&quot;Was he not in love with my mother before she
married my father?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Bezel turned away her head, and the color rose
to her face. The nervous movement of her hands
plucking at her dress showed how profoundly she was
moved by this question.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I believe so. But she&mdash;Mrs. Larcher loved her
husband.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then why was my father jealous of Jeringham?&quot;
said Claude, who could not reconcile this statement
with the evidence given at the trial.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How should I know?&quot; cried Mrs. Bezel, turning
on him with sudden passion. &quot;If George Larcher
had not been so blinded by jealousy he would have
seen that there was nothing between them. Your
mother knew Jeringham all his life; they were like
brother and sister. It is true he wished to marry her,
but when he saw that her heart was given to your
father, he bowed to her decision. He came to Horriston
as her friend, not as her lover.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But he was constantly with her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you dare to speak thus of your mother, sir?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&mdash;I cannot help doing so,&quot; stammered Claude,
startled by the anger in her voice. &quot;God knows I
wish to revere the memory of my mother, but I cannot
help seeing that she was morally responsible for the
tragedy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She was not! She was not!&quot; said Mrs. Bezel
vehemently. &quot;How dare you speak thus? Your
father neglected her. He left her to the companionship
of Mark Jeringham, while he indulged in his
predilection for literary work. All day long he shut
himself up in his study, and let his wife sit alone, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[pg&nbsp;92]</span>
miserable. Was it any wonder, then, that she should
turn to her old friend for consolation? There was
nothing between them&mdash;nothing to which any Pharisee
could have taken exception.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But surely my father was sufficiently sensible to
see all this?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He saw nothing, or what he did see was distorted
by his jealousy. The police, in their endeavors to fix
the crime on your mother, took the same view of the
relations between her and Jeringham. Oh, I know
what you read in those papers shown to you by Mr.
Hilliston!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">So surprised was Claude by this unexpected introduction
of his guardian&#39;s name that he could not suppress
a start.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How do you know that Mr. Hilliston showed me
the papers?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Bezel saw that she had said too much, but,
unable to go back on her words, rapidly resolved to
make that revelation which she had hitherto intended
to keep as a last resource.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Hilliston told me that he had done so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you know him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Mrs. Bezel, seizing her opportunity to
lead up to the revelation. &quot;I know him as the best
and kindest of men. I know him as one who has
been a good friend to you&mdash;orphan as you thought
yourself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Orphan as I thought myself,&quot; muttered Claude,
turning pale. &quot;Is it not true&mdash;am I not an orphan?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Great Heavens! What is this you tell me? My
father&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>[pg&nbsp;93]</span>
&quot;Your father is dead. He was murdered, as you
know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then my mother?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Bezel looked at the agonized face of the young
man, and covered her own, with a quick indrawn
breath.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She lives!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My mother! She lives! Are you mad? She died
in London shortly after her acquittal.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So it was supposed, but it was not true. Could
you expect that unhappy woman to face the scorn and
contempt of the world after having been accused of
her husband&#39;s murder? She did not die, save to the
world. She fled from society and sought refuge here&mdash;here
where she lies a helpless invalid.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mrs. Bezel!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am not Mrs. Bezel. I am your mother.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;God! My mother!&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="chXII" id="chXII"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<p class="h3">REVELATIONS.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was only natural that a silence should ensue
between these two so strangely brought together.
Claude, seated pale and anguished in his chair, tried to
collect his thoughts, and stared wildly at his mother.
She, with her face buried in the cushions, sobbed
bitterly. After the way in which her son had spoken,
it was cruel that she should have been forced to make
such a revelation at such a moment. He condemned,
he reproached, her conduct in the past, and she again
tasted the full bitterness of the cup which had been
held to her lips twenty-five years before.</p>

<p class="indent">On his part Claude did not know what to say; he
hardly knew what to think. Convinced by a perusal
of the papers that his mother was morally guilty of his
father&#39;s death, he was overwhelmed to find that she
was still alive, and capable, for all he knew, of offering
a defense for her share in the tragedy. After all,
he had no right to judge her until he heard what she
had to say. Blood is thicker than water, and she was
his mother.</p>

<p class="indent">Now he saw the reason why Hilliston objected to his
calling at Hampstead; why he advised him to let
sleeping dogs lie. After so long a period it was
worse than useless to bring mother and son together.
Their thoughts, their aims, their lives, were entirely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>[pg&nbsp;95]</span>
diverse, and only pain could be caused by such a meeting.
Claude silently acknowledged the wisdom of
Hilliston&#39;s judgment, but at the same time could
hardly refrain from condemning him for having kept
him so long in ignorance of the truth.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Bezel&mdash;as we must still continue to call her&mdash;was
astonished at this long silence, but raised her head
to cast a timid glance at Claude. His brow was
gloomy, his lips were firmly set, and he looked anything
but overjoyed at the revelation which she had
made. Guessing his thoughts, the unhappy woman
made a gesture of despair, and spoke in a low voice,
broken by sobs.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You, too, condemn me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, mother,&quot; he replied, and Mrs. Bezel winced as
she heard him acknowledge the relationship; &quot;I do
not condemn you. I have heard one side of the question.
I must now hear the other&mdash;from you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What more can I tell you than what you already
know,&quot; she said, drying her eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I must know the reason why you let me think you
dead all these years.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was by my own wish, and by the advice of Mr.
Hilliston.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Claude bit his lip at the mention of this name, and
cast a hasty glance round the splendidly furnished
room. A frightful suspicion had entered his mind;
but she was his mother, and he did not dare to give it
utterance. His mother guessed his thoughts, and
spared him the pain of speaking. With a womanly disregard
for the truth she promptly lied concerning the
relationship which her son suspected to exist between
his guardian and herself.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>[pg&nbsp;96]</span>
&quot;You need not look so black, Claude, and think ill
of me. I am unfortunate, but not guilty. All that
you see here is mine; purchased by my own money.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your own money?&quot; replied Claude, heaving a sigh
of relief.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes! Mr. Hilliston, who has been a good friend
to me, saved sufficient out of my marriage settlement
to enable me to furnish this cottage, and live comfortably.
It is just as well,&quot; added she bitterly, &quot;else I
might have died on the streets.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But why did you let Hilliston bring me up to think
I was an orphan?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I did not wish to shadow your life. I did not wish
you to change your name. I had to change mine,
and retire from the world, but that was part of my
punishment.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Still if&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was impossible, I tell you, Claude,&quot; interrupted
his mother impatiently. &quot;When you grew up you
would have asked questions, and then I would have been
forced to tell you all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yet, in spite of your precautions, I do know all. If
you took all this trouble to hide the truth, why reveal
it to me now?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Bezel pointed to three books lying on an adjacent
table. Claude quite understood what she meant.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I see,&quot; he remarked, before she could speak, &quot;you
think that the author of that book knows about my
father&#39;s murder.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am certain he does. But what he knows, or how
he knows, I cannot say. Still, I am certain of one
thing, that he tells the story from hearsay.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What makes you think that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>[pg&nbsp;97]</span>
&quot;It would take too long to tell you my reasons. It
is sufficient to state that the fictitious case differs from
the real case in several important particulars. For
instance,&quot; she added, with a derisive smile, &quot;the
guilty person is said to be Michael Dene, and he
is&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is drawn from Mr. Hilliston.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How do you know that?&quot; she asked, with a
startled air.</p>

<p class="indent">Claude shrugged his shoulders. &quot;I have eyes to
read and brains to comprehend,&quot; he said quietly;
&quot;There is no doubt in my mind that the lawyer of the
fiction is meant for the lawyer of real life. Otherwise,
I think the writer drew on his imagination. It was
necessary for him to end his story by fixing on one of
the characters as a criminal; and owing to the exigencies
of the plot, as developed by himself, he chose
Michael Dene, otherwise Mr. Hilliston, as the murderer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you don&#39;t think&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, no! I don&#39;t think Mr. Hilliston is guilty. I
read the trial very carefully, and moreover I do not
see what motive he could have to commit the crime.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The motive of Michael Dene is love for the murdered
man&#39;s wife.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In other words, the author assumes that Hilliston
loved you,&quot; said Claude coolly; &quot;but I have your
assurance that such is not the case.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You speak to me like that,&quot; cried Mrs. Bezel
angrily; &quot;to your mother?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Larcher&#39;s expression did not change. He turned a
trifle paler, and compressed his lips firmly, otherwise
he gave no outward sign of his emotion. Knowing so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>[pg&nbsp;98]</span>
much of the case as he did, he could not look on this
woman in the light of a mother; she had indirectly
contributed to his father&#39;s death; she had deserted
him for twenty-five years; and now that she claimed
his filial reverence, he was unwilling to yield it to her.
Perhaps he was unjust and harsh to think this, but the
natural tie between them was so weakened by time
and ignorance that he could find no affection in his
heart to bestow on her. To him she was a stranger&mdash;nothing
more.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let us understand each other,&quot; he said coldly.
&quot;That you are my mother is no doubt true, but I ask
you if you have performed your maternal duties? You
obliterated yourself from my life; you left me to be
brought up by strangers; in all ways you only consulted
your own desires. Can you then expect me to yield
you that filial obedience which every mother has a
right to expect from her son? If you&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Enough, sir,&quot; said Mrs. Bezel, white with anger,
&quot;say no more. I understand you only too well, and
now regret that I sought this interview, which has
resulted so ill. I hoped that you would be glad to
find your mother still alive; that you would cherish
her in her affliction. I see I was wrong. You are as
cold and bitter as was your father.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My father?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. Do you think that all the wrong was on my
side. Had I nothing to forgive him? Ah! I see by
your face that you know to what I allude. It was
your father and my husband who betrayed me for
Mona Bantry.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have no proof of that,&quot; said Claude, in a low
voice.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>[pg&nbsp;99]</span>
&quot;I have every proof. The girl told me with her
own lips. I returned from that ball at three o&#39;clock
in the morning, and Mr. Jeringham left me at the
door. I entered the house alone and proceeded to
my sitting room. There I found Mona and&mdash;my
husband.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah! He did return from London on that night?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. He returned, thinking I was out of the way,
in order to see his mistress. In his presence she confessed
her guilt. I looked to him for denial, and he
hung his head. Then hardly knowing what I did,
overcome with rage, I snatched the dagger which I
wore as part of my costume, and&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And killed him,&quot; shrieked Claude, springing to his
feet. &quot;For Heaven&#39;s sake, do not confess this to me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why not? I did no wrong! I did not kill him.
I fainted before I could cross the room to where he
stood. When I recovered I was alone. My husband
and Mona Bantry had disappeared. Then I retired to
bed and was ill for days. I know no more of the case.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is this true?&quot; asked Claude anxiously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why should it not be true? Do you think I would
invent a story like that to asperse the memory of your
father? Vilely as he treated me, I loved him. I do
not know who killed him. The dagger I wore disappeared
with him. It was found in the garden; his
body in the river four miles down. But I declare to
you solemnly that I am ignorant of whose hand struck
the blow. It might have been Mona, or Jeringham,
or&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Or Hilliston!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are wrong there,&quot; replied his mother coolly,
&quot;or else your judgment has been perverted by that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[pg&nbsp;100]</span>
book. Mr. Hilliston was still at the ball when the
tragedy occurred. His evidence at the trial proved
that. Don&#39;t say a word against him. He has been a
good friend to you&mdash;and to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do not deny that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You cannot! When I was arrested and tried for
a crime which I never committed, he stood by me.
When I left the court alone and friendless, he stood
by me. I decided to feign death to escape the obloquy
which attaches to every suspected criminal. He found
me this refuge and installed me here as Mrs. Bezel.
He took charge of you and brought you up, and
looked after your money and mine. Don&#39;t you dare to
speak against him!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Exhausted by the fury with which she had spoken,
the unfortunate woman leaned back in her chair.
Claude, already regretting his harshness, brought a
glass of water, which he placed to her lips. After a
few minutes she revived, and feebly waved him away;
but he was not to be so easily dismissed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am sorry I spoke as I did, mother,&quot; he said
tenderly, arranging her pillows. &quot;Now that I have
heard your story, I see that you have suffered
greatly. It is not my right to reproach you. No
doubt you acted for the best; therefore, I do not say
a word against you or Mr. Hilliston, but ask you to
forgive me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The tears were rolling down Mrs. Bezel&#39;s cheeks
as he spoke thus, and without uttering a word, she
put her hand in his in token of forgiveness. Claude
pressed his lip to her faded cheek, and thus reconciled&mdash;as
much as was possible under the circumstances&mdash;they
began to talk of the case.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg&nbsp;101]</span>
&quot;What do you intend to do?&quot; asked Mrs. Bezel
weakly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Find out who killed my father.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is impossible&mdash;after five-and-twenty years. I
have told you all I know, and you see I cannot help
you. I do not know whom to suspect.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You surely have some suspicion, mother?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I have no suspicions. Whomsoever killed
your father took the dagger out of my sitting room.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps Mona&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think not. She had no reason to kill him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He had wronged her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And me!&quot; cried Mrs. Bezel vehemently. &quot;Do
not talk any more of these things, Claude. I know
nothing more; I can tell you nothing more.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then I must try and find John Parver, and learn
how he became acquainted with the story.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is why I sent for you; why I revealed myself;
why I told you all I have suffered. Find John Parver,
and tell me who he is, what he is.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This Claude promised to do, and, as his mother was
worn out by the long conversation, he shortly afterward
took his leave. As he descended Fitzjohn&#39;s
Avenue a thought flashed into his mind as to the
identity of John Parver.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wonder if John Parver is Mark Jeringham?&quot;
said Claude.</p>

<p class="indent">The question was to be answered on that very
evening.</p>

<h2><a name="chXIII" id="chXIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<p class="h3">ON THE TRACK.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was nearly six o&#39;clock when Claude returned to
Earls Street, and Tait, already dressed for the evening,
was waiting his arrival with considerable impatience.
His usual imperturbability had given place to a self-satisfied
air, as though he had succeeded in accomplishing
a difficult undertaking. He uttered a joyful
exclamation when he saw Claude enter, but a look
of apprehension passed over his face when he noted
the altered appearance of his friend.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is wrong?&quot; he asked, as Claude threw himself
into a chair, with a sigh of fatigue. &quot;Do you
bring bad news? My dear fellow, you are completely
worn out. Here, Dormer, a glass of sherry for Mr.
Larcher.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The servant, who was putting the finishing touches
to the dinner-table, speedily obeyed this order, and
Tait made his friend drink the wine without delay.
Then he proceeded to question him regarding the
reason of his pallor, but with his usual caution first
sent Dormer out of the room. Only when they were
alone did he venture to speak on the subject about
which both were thinking.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well!&quot; he demanded anxiously, &quot;you saw Mrs.
Bezel?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; I was with her for two hours.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[pg&nbsp;103]</span>
&quot;Ah!&quot; said Tait, with great satisfaction; &quot;she
must have told you a good deal in that time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She did. She told me more than I expected.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did it concern your parents?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It did.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good! Then you no doubt heard her version of
the crime.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">These unsatisfactory replies, which dropped so
strangely from Larcher&#39;s lips, at once puzzled and
irritated the questioner.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You don&#39;t seem anxious to confide in me,&quot; he said,
in a piqued tone.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will tell you all. I am anxious to tell you all,&quot;
replied Larcher, finding his tongue, &quot;but I do not
know how to begin.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I shall save you that trouble by asking you
questions. In the first place, who is Mrs. Bezel?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My mother!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tait bounded from his chair with an expression of
incredulity. This unexpected information, so abruptly
conveyed, was too much for his self-control.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your mother!&quot; he stammered, hardly thinking
he had heard aright. &quot;Are you in earnest? I cannot
believe it. According to the notice in the newspapers,
according to Hilliston, your mother died in London in
1867.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She did not die. Her death was a feigned one, to
escape the notoriety gained by her trial at Canterbury.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did Mr. Hilliston know she was alive?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. It was by his advice that she changed her
name.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh! Oh!&quot; said Tait, with marked significance;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>[pg&nbsp;104]</span>
&quot;Hilliston knew, Hilliston advised. Humph! John
Parver may be right, after all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tait, be silent! You are speaking of my mother.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I beg your pardon, my dear fellow, but I really do
not understand.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You will shortly. I will tell you the story of my
mother&#39;s troubles, and Hilliston&#39;s kindness.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hilliston&#39;s kindness,&quot; repeated Tait, in a skeptical
tone. Nevertheless he resumed his seat, and signified
his willingness to hear the narrative.</p>

<p class="indent">The wine had done Claude good, and restored his
self-possession; so, now master of himself, he related
all that had passed between himself and Mrs. Bezel.
Gifted with a retentive memory, and no mean powers
as a narrator, he succeeded in giving Tait a vivid
impression of the conversation. The little man, with
his head slightly on one side, like a bright-eyed
sparrow, listened attentively, and not till the story was
finished did he make an observation thereon. To this
capability of listening without interruption Tait owed
a great deal of his popularity.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Truth is stranger than fiction, after all,&quot; said he,
when Claude ended; &quot;and the novel is less dramatic
than the episode of real life. John Parver did not
dare to insinuate that the supposed dead widow of the
murdered man was alive. Humph! this complicates
matters more than ever.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;At least it clears the character of Hilliston.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; assented Tait doubtfully; &quot;I suppose it
does.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can you doubt it?&quot; said Larcher, dissatisfied with
this grudging consent. &quot;You can now see why Hilliston
was agitated at our interview; why he asked me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[pg&nbsp;105]</span>
not to see Mrs. Bezel, so-called; why he called here
the same evening to find out if I had gone; and finally
why he wished to prepare me before seeing her, by telling
of the tragedy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I see all that,&quot; said Tait quietly. &quot;Nine men
out of ten would consider Hilliston a most disinterested
person. But I am the tenth man, and am therefore
skeptical of his motive.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But what motive can he have for&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is just it,&quot; interrupted Tait vivaciously. &quot;I
can&#39;t see his motive, but I will find it out some
day.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, you can speak for yourself,&quot; said Claude,
frowning. &quot;After what my mother has told me, I
believe Hilliston to be an upright and honorable
man.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are quite right to do so on the evidence.
Still, if I were you I would not keep him informed of
all our movements, unless&mdash;&mdash;Do you intend to go
on with the matter?&quot; he asked abruptly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Assuredly! I am determined to find out who killed
my father.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tait walked to the fireplace and took up his position
on the hearth-rug. An idea had entered his mind,
which he did not intend to put into words. Nevertheless
it was indirectly the reason for his next speech.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think, after all, it would be best to take Hilliston&#39;s
advice, and let sleeping dogs lie.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He had not calculated the effect of these words on
his hearer, for Claude also arose from his chair, and
looked at him with angry surprise.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t understand you,&quot; he said coldly. &quot;Some
hours back, and you were more eager than I to pursue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[pg&nbsp;106]</span>
this unknown criminal. Now you wish to withdraw.
May I ask the reason of this sudden change.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It seems to be useless to hope to find the
assassin,&quot; replied Tait, shrugging his shoulders.
&quot;One cannot discover a needle in a haystack.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes you can&mdash;by patient research.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, even that would be easier than to hope to
solve a mystery which has been impenetrable for five-and-twenty
years.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It has been impenetrable for that time because no
one has tried to solve it. This is not your real reason
for wishing to end the case. What is your reason?
Speak! I insist upon knowing the truth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The other did not reply, but thrust his hands deeper
into his pockets, and maintained a masterly silence.
Irritated by this negative attitude, Claude placed his
hands on the little man&#39;s shoulders and looked at him
indignantly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know what your reason is, Tait,&quot; he said
rapidly; &quot;it is not that you fear we may learn too
little, but that you expect we will learn too much.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Tait simply, &quot;that is the reason.
Is it not an all-sufficient one for you to pause?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No!&quot; shouted Claude savagely; &quot;it is all-sufficient
for me to go on. You think that I may discover that
Hilliston is the criminal, or learn that my mother is
accountable for the crime. I tell you no such thing
will happen. Hilliston was not near The Laurels
on the fatal morning. My mother&mdash;I have told you
how she exonerated herself, and the exoneration was
substantiated by Denis Bantry. Both are innocent.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It may be so. But who is guilty?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jeringham. I believe that he discovered that my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>[pg&nbsp;107]</span>
father had returned, and perhaps knowing of this
intrigue between him and Mona Bantry, remained at
The Laurels, unknown to my mother, in order to
assist her as a friend.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How did Jeringham obtain possession of the
dagger?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I cannot say. We must find out. But he did
obtain possession of the dagger, and during a quarrel
with my father killed him with it. He fled to avoid
the consequences. Oh, yes! I swear that Jeringham
is guilty. But I will hunt him down, if I have to do it
alone.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You will not do it alone,&quot; said Tait quietly. &quot;I
am with you still.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you said&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know what I said! I think it is best to leave
well alone. But since you are set on learning
the truth, I will help you to the best of my ability.
Only,&quot; added Tait explicitly, &quot;should you discover the
truth to be unpalatable, do not blame me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I won&#39;t blame you. I am certain that you will
find that I am right, and that Hilliston and my mother
had nothing to do with the affair. Help me, that is
all I ask. I will bear the consequences.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very good! Then we had better get to work,&quot;
said Tait dryly. &quot;Just go and dress, my dear fellow,
or you&#39;ll keep dinner waiting.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why should I dress? I am not going out to-night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Indeed you are! We are due at Mrs. Durham&#39;s &#39;At
Home&#39; at ten o&#39;clock.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shan&#39;t go. I am in no mood for frivolity. I
would rather stay at home and think over the case.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>[pg&nbsp;108]</span>
It is only by hard work that we can hope to learn the
truth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very true. At the same time it is necessary for
you to go out to-night, if only to meet with John
Parver.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The author of &#39;A Whim of Fate,&#39;&quot; asked Claude
eagerly, &quot;is he in town?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. And he will be at Mrs. Durham&#39;s to-night.
We must see him, and find out where he obtained the
materials for his novel.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you think such information will lead to any
result?&quot; asked Claude dubiously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t think. I am sure of it,&quot; retorted Tait
impatiently. &quot;Now go and dress.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Larcher departed without a word.</p>

<h2><a name="chXIV" id="chXIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<p class="h3">THE UPPER BOHEMIA.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> name Bohemia is suggestive of unknown talent
starving in garrets, of obdurate landladies, of bacchanalian
nights, and shabby dress. Murger first
invested the name with this flavor, and since his time
the word has become polarized, and indicates nothing
but struggling humanity and unappreciated genius.
Yet your true Bohemian does not leave his country
when he becomes rich and famous. It is true that he
descends from the garret to the first floor; that he
fares well and dresses decently; but he still dwells in
Bohemia. The reckless air of the hovels permeates
the palaces of this elastic kingdom of fancy.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Durham was a Bohemian, and every Thursday
received her <i>confrères</i> in the drawing room of a very
elegant mansion in Chelsea. She had written a novel,
&quot;I Cling to Thee with Might and Main,&quot; and this having
met with a moderate success, she posed as a celebrity,
and set up her <i>salon</i> on the lines of Lady Blessington.
Everyone who was anyone was received at
her &quot;At Homes,&quot; and by this process she gathered
together a queer set of people. Some were clever,
others were not; some were respectable, others
decidedly disreputable; but one and all&mdash;to use an
expression usually connected with crime&mdash;had done
something. Novelists, essayists, painters, poets, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>[pg&nbsp;110]</span>
musicians were all to be found in her rooms, and a
more motley collection could be seen nowhere else
in London. Someone dubbed the Chelsea Mansions
&quot;The Zoo,&quot; and certainly animals of all kinds were to
be found there, from monkeys to peacocks.</p>

<p class="indent">It was considered rather the thing to be invited
to &quot;The Zoo,&quot; so when brothers and sisters of the
pen met one another there they usually said: &quot;What!
are you here?&quot; as though the place were heaven, and
the speaker justifiably surprised that anyone should be
saved except himself or herself. Literary people love
one another a degree less than Christians.</p>

<p class="indent">Hither came Tait and Claude in search of John
Parver. That young man had made a great success
with his novel, and was consequently much sought
after by lion hunters. However, Tait had learned
that he was to be present at Mrs. Durham&#39;s on this
special evening, and hoped to engage him in conversation,
so as to learn where he had obtained the materials
for his story.</p>

<p class="indent">When they arrived the rooms were quite full, and
Mrs. Durham received them very graciously. It was
true that they were not famous, still as Tait was a
society man, and Claude very handsome, the lady of
the house good-humoredly pardoned all mental deficiencies.
Tait knew her very well, having met her at
several houses, but she addressed herself rather to
Claude than to his friend, having a feminine appreciation
of good looks.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My rooms are always crowded,&quot; said she, with
that colossal egotism which distinguished her utterances.
&quot;You know they call me the new George
Eliot.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[pg&nbsp;111]</span>
&quot;No doubt you deserve the name,&quot; replied Claude,
with mimic gravity.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I suppose so,&quot; smirked the lady amiably.
&quot;You have read my novel, of course. It is now in its
fourth edition, and has been refused by Smith and
Mudie. I follow the French school of speaking my
mind.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And a very nasty mind it must be,&quot; thought
Larcher, who had been informed about the book
by Tait. He did not, however, give this thought
utterance, but endeavored to generalize the conversation.
&quot;You have many celebrities here to-night,
I presume?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My Dear Sir!&quot; exclaimed Mrs. Durham, in capitals,
&quot;every individual in this company is famous! Yonder
is Mr. Padsop, the great traveler, who wrote &#39;Mosques
and Mosquitoes.&#39; He is talking to Miss Pexworth, the
writer of those scathing articles in <i>The Penny Trumpet</i>,
entitled &#39;Man, the Brute.&#39; She is a modern woman.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, indeed!&quot; said Claude equably, and looked at
this latest production of the nineteenth century, &quot;she
is rather masculine in appearance.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is her pride to be so, Mr. Larcher. She is more
masculine than man. That is her brother, who designs
ladies&#39; dresses and decorates dinner tables.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah! He isn&#39;t masculine. I suppose nature
wanted to preserve the balance in the family. The
law of compensation, eh?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, you are severe. Tommy Pexworth is a dear
little creature, and so fond of chiffons. He knows
more about women&#39;s dress than his sister.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So I should think,&quot; replied Claude dryly. He
took an instant and violent dislike to Mr. Pexworth,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>[pg&nbsp;112]</span>
who was one of those feminine little creatures, only
distinguished from the other sex by wearing trousers.
&quot;A charming pair,&quot; he added, smiling. &quot;I don&#39;t
know which I admire the most. The sister who is
such a thorough gentlemen, or the brother who is
a perfect lady.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are satirical,&quot; smiled Mrs. Durham, enjoying
this hit at her friends. &quot;Now you must take me down
to have some refreshment. Really, you must.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Thus inspired, Claude elbowed the hostess through
the crush, and escorted her to a bare counter in the
dining room, whereon were displayed thin bread and
butter, very weak tea, and fossil buns. Mrs. Durham
evidently knew her own refreshments too well to partake
of them, for she had a mild brandy and soda, produced
from its hiding place by a confidential waiter.
She asked Claude to join her, but he refused on the
plea that he never drank between meals.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you are not a brain-worker,&quot; said Mrs. Durham,
hurriedly finishing her brandy and soda, lest her
guests should see it and become discontented with the
weak tea; &quot;if I did not keep myself up I should die.
Ah! Why, here is Mr. Hilliston.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hilliston!&quot; said Claude, astonished at seeing his
guardian in this house.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. Do you know him? A dear creature&mdash;so
clever. He was my solicitor in a libel action against
<i>The Penny Trumpet</i>, for saying that I was an
ungrammatical scribbler. Just fancy! And they call
me the new George Eliot. We lost our case, I&#39;m sorry
to say. Judges are such brutes! Miss Pexworth says
they are, ever since she failed to get damages for her
breach of promise case.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>[pg&nbsp;113]</span>
&quot;Here comes Mr. Hilliston,&quot; said Larcher, rather
tired of this long-tongued lady. &quot;I know him very
well, he is my guardian.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How very delightful!&quot; said Mrs. Durham, with the
accent on the &quot;very.&quot; &quot;Oh, Mr. Hilliston,&quot; she
continued, as the lawyer approached, &quot;we were just
talking about you!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I trust the absent were right for once,&quot; replied
Hilliston, with an artificial smile and a swift glance at
Claude. &quot;I have just come to say good-by.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, not yet, surely not yet! Really!&quot; babbled
Mrs. Durham with shallow enthusiasm. Then finding
Hilliston was resolved to go, and catching sight of a
newly arrived celebrity, she hastened, after the amiable
fashion of her kind, to speed the parting guest.
&quot;Well, if you must, you must. Good-by, good-by!
Excuse me, I see Mr. Rawler, a delightful man&mdash;writes
plays, you know. The new Shakspere; yes!&quot; and thus
talking she melted away with a babble of words, leaving
Hilliston and his ward alone.</p>

<p class="indent">They were mutually surprised to see one another,
Claude because he knew his guardian did not affect
Bohemianism, and Hilliston because he thought that
the young man had left town. The meeting was
hardly a pleasant one, as Hilliston dreaded lest Mrs.
Bezel should have said too much, and so prejudiced
Claude against him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I understood from your refusal of my invitation
that you had gone to Thorston with Tait,&quot; said he,
after a pause.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am going to-morrow or the next day,&quot; replied
Claude quickly, &quot;but in any event I intended to call
on you before I left town.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[pg&nbsp;114]</span>
&quot;Indeed!&quot; said Hilliston nervously; &quot;you have
something to tell me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. I have seen Mrs. Bezel.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good. You have seen Mrs. Bezel.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And I have made a discovery.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh! Has the lady informed you who committed
the crime?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No. But she told me her name.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Margaret Bezel!&quot; murmured Hilliston, wondering
what was coming.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not Margaret Bezel, but Julia Larcher, my
mother.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She&mdash;she told you that?&quot; gasped Hilliston, his
self-control deserting him for the moment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. I know why she feigned death; I know how
you have protected her. You have been a kind friend
to me, Mr. Hilliston, and to my mother. I am doubly
in your debt.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hilliston took the hand held out to him by Claude,
and pressed it cordially. The speech relieved him
from all apprehension. He now knew that Mrs.
Bezel had kept their secret, and immediately took
advantage of the restored confidence of Claude. His
quick wit grasped the situation at once.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear fellow,&quot; he said with much emotion, &quot;I
loved your poor father too much not to do what I
could for his widow and son. I hope you do not
blame me for suppressing the truth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No. I suppose you acted for the best. Still, I
would rather you had informed me that my mother was
still alive.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To what end? It would only have made you
miserable. I did not want to reveal anything; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[pg&nbsp;115]</span>
your mother insisted that you should be made acquainted
with the past, and so&mdash;I gave you the papers.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am glad you did so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And now, what do you intend to do?&quot; asked
Hilliston slowly. &quot;You know as much as I do. Is
there any clew to guide you in the discovery that your
mother still lives?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No. She can tell me nothing. But I hope to
find the clew here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah! You intend to speak with John Parver?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do,&quot; said Claude, rather surprised at this penetration;
&quot;do you know him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I exchanged a few words with him,&quot; replied Hilliston
carelessly. &quot;I only came here to-night at the
request of Mrs. Durham, who is a client of mine. As
I paid my respects to her, she was talking to John
Parver, and he was introduced to me as the latest lion.
So you still intend to pursue the matter?&quot; added
Hilliston, after a pause.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Assuredly! If only to clear my mother, and
restore her to the world.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am afraid it is too late, Claude. You know she
is ill and cannot live long.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nevertheless, I wish her to take her own name
again. She will not do so until the assassin of her
husband&mdash;of my father&mdash;is discovered, so you see it is
obligatory on me to find out the truth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I trust you may be successful,&quot; said Hilliston,
sighing; &quot;but my advice is still the same, and it
would be best for you to let the matter rest. After
five-and-twenty years you can discover nothing. I
cannot help you; your mother cannot help you,
so&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>[pg&nbsp;116]</span>
&quot;But John Parver may,&quot; interrupted Larcher
sharply. &quot;I will see how he learned the details of
the case.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Before Hilliston could make further objection,
Tait joined them, and not noticing the lawyer, hastily
took Claude by the arm.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have been looking for you everywhere,&quot; said he.
&quot;Come and be introduced to Mr. Linton.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who is Mr. Linton?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;John Parver. He writes under that name. Ah,
Mr. Hilliston, I did not see you. How do you do,
sir?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am quite well, Mr. Tait, and am just taking my
departure,&quot; replied Hilliston easily. &quot;I see you are
both set on finding out the truth. But you will learn
nothing from John Parver.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why not, Mr. Hilliston?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because he knows nothing. Good-night, Claude&mdash;good-night,
Mr. Tait!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">When Hilliston disappeared Tait looked at Claude
with a singular expression, and scratched his chin.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You see,&quot; said he quietly, &quot;Mr. Hilliston has
been making inquiries on his own account.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are incurably suspicious,&quot; said Claude impatiently.
&quot;Hilliston is my friend.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. He was your father&#39;s friend also, I believe.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing! Nothing! Come and cross-examine
Frank Linton, alias John Parver.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Clearly Tait was by no means so satisfied with Hilliston
as Claude.</p>

<h2><a name="chXV" id="chXV"></a>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<p class="h3">A POPULAR AUTHOR.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Bearing</span> in mind that the character of Hilliston had
been rehabilitated by Mrs. Bezel, it was natural that
Claude should feel somewhat annoyed at the persistent
mistrust manifested toward that gentleman by Tait.
However, he had no time to explain or expostulate at
the present moment; and moreover, as he knew that
the little man was assisting him in this difficult case
out of pure friendship, he did not deem it politic to
comment on what was assuredly an unfounded prejudice.
Tait was singular in his judgments, stubborn
in his opinions; so Claude, unwilling to risk the loss
of his coadjutor, wisely held his peace. His astute
companion guessed these thoughts, for in place of
further remarking on the inexplicable presence of
Hilliston, he turned the conversation toward the man
they were about to see.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Queer thing, isn&#39;t it?&quot; he said, as they ascended
the stairs. &quot;Linton is the son of the vicar of
Thorston.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah! That no doubt accounts for his intimate
knowledge of the locality. Do you know him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course I do&mdash;as Frank Linton; but I had no
idea that he was John Parver.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why did he assume a <i>nom de plume</i>?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>[pg&nbsp;118]</span>
Tait shrugged his shoulders. &quot;Paternal prejudice,
I believe,&quot; he said carelessly. &quot;Mr. Linton does not
approve of sensational novels, and, moreover, wishes
his son to be a lawyer, not a literary man. Young
Frank is in a solicitor&#39;s office in Lincoln&#39;s Inn Fields,
and he employed his evenings in writing &#39;A Whim of
Fate.&#39; He published it under the name of &#39;John
Parver,&#39; so as to hoodwink his father, but now that he
has scored a success I have no doubt he will confess.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you think we will learn anything from him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We will learn all we wish to know as to where he
obtained his material. The young man&#39;s head is
turned, and by playing on his vanity we may find out
the truth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;His vanity may lead him to conceal the fact that
he took the plot from real life.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t think so. I know the boy well, and he is
a great babbler. No one is more astonished than I at
learning that he is the celebrated John Parver. I
didn&#39;t think he had the brains to produce so clever a
book.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is clever!&quot; assented Claude absently.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course it is; much cleverer than its author,&quot;
retorted Tait dryly; &quot;or rather, I should say, its supposed
author, for I verily believed Jenny Paynton
helped him to write the book.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who is Jenny Paynton?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A very nice girl who lives at Thorston. She is
twice as clever as this lad, and they are both great on
literary matters. But I&#39;ll tell you all about this later
on, for here is Linton.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The celebrated author was a light-haired, light-complexioned
young man of six-and-twenty, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>[pg&nbsp;119]</span>
bowed shoulders, a self-satisfied smile, and a pince nez,
which he used at times to emphasize his remarks. He
evidently possessed conceit sufficient to stock a dozen
ordinary men, and lisped out the newest ideas of the
day, as promulgated by his college, for he was an
Oxford man. Although he was still in his salad days,
he had settled, to his own satisfaction, all the questions
of life, and therefore adopted a calm superiority which
was peculiarly exasperating. Claude, liberal-minded
but hot-blooded, had not been five minutes in his
company before he was seized with a wild desire to
throw him out of the window. Frank Linton inspired
that uncharitable feeling in many people.</p>

<p class="indent">For the moment, Mr. Linton was alone, as his
latest worshiper, a raw-boned female of the cab-horse
species, had just departed with a fat little painter in quest
of refreshment. Therefore, when he turned to greet
Claude, he was quite prepared to assume that fatigued
self-conscious air, with which he thought fit to welcome
new votaries.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Linton, this is Mr. Larcher,&quot; said Tait abruptly.
&quot;Claude, you see before you the lion of the season.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is very good of you to say so, Mr. Tait,&quot; simpered
the lion, in no wise disclaiming the compliment.
&quot;I am pleased to make your acquaintance, Mr.
Larcher.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And I yours, Mr. Linton, or shall I say Mr.
Parver?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, either name will answer,&quot; said the author
loftily, &quot;though in town I am known as Parver only.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And in Thorston as Linton,&quot; interpolated Tait
smartly. &quot;Then your father does not yet know what
a celebrated son he has?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>[pg&nbsp;120]</span>
&quot;Not yet, Mr. Tait. I intend to tell him next week.
I go down to Thorston for that purpose.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah! My friend and I will no doubt meet you
there. We also seek rural felicity for a month. But
now that you have taken London by storm, I suppose
you intend to forsake the law for the profits.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course I do,&quot; replied Linton quickly. &quot;I never
cared for the law, and only went into it to please my
father.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And now you go into literature to please Miss
Paynton.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Linton blushed at this home thrust, and being
readier with the pen than the tongue, did not know
what answer to make. Pitying his confusion, and
anxious to arrive at the main object of the interview,
Claude interpolated a remark bearing thereon.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did you find it difficult to work out the plot of
your novel, Mr. Linton?&quot; he said, with assumed carelessness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, not at all! The construction of a plot is
second nature with me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose you and Miss Paynton talked it over
together,&quot; said Tait artfully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, yes,&quot; answered Linton, again falling into
confusion; &quot;I found her a good listener.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I presume it was all new to her?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think so. Of course she gave me some hints.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evidently Linton was determined to admit nothing,
so seeing that Tait&#39;s attack was thus repulsed, Claude
brought up his reserve forces.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I saw in a paper the other day that your book was
an impossible one&mdash;that nothing analogous to its story
ever happened in real life.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>[pg&nbsp;121]</span>
&quot;Several critics have said that,&quot; replied Linton,
growing angry, and thereby losing his caution, &quot;but
they are wrong, as I could prove did I choose to do so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What!&quot; said Claude, in feigned astonishment.
&quot;Did you take the incident from real life?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The tale is founded on an incident from real life,&quot;
answered Linton, flushing. &quot;That is, Miss Paynton
told me of a certain crime which was actually committed,
and on her hint I worked out the story.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Miss Paynton told you,&quot; said Tait smoothly;
&quot;and where did she see the account of this crime?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, that I cannot tell you,&quot; replied Linton frankly.
&quot;She related the history of this crime, and refused to
let me know whence she obtained it. I thought the
idea a good one, and so wrote the novel.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why don&#39;t you tell this to the world, and so confound
the critics?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do! I have told several people. For instance,
I told a gentleman about it this very evening, just
because he made the same remark as Mr. Larcher
did.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tait drew a long breath, and stole a look at Claude.
That young man had changed color and gave utterance
to the first idea that entered his mind.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Was it Mr. Hilliston who made the remark?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hilliston! Hilliston!&quot; said Linton thoughtfully.
&quot;Yes, I believe that was the man. A tall old gentleman,
very fresh-colored. He was greatly interested
in my literary work.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who could help being interested in so clever a
book?&quot; said Claude, in a meaning tone. &quot;But Mr.
Hilliston is a lawyer, and I suppose you do not like
members of that profession.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>[pg&nbsp;122]</span>
&quot;Now, why should you say that?&quot; demanded
Linton, rather taken aback by this perspicacity.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, for one thing you admit a dislike for the law,
and for another you make Michael Dene, the solicitor,
commit the crime in &#39;A Whim of Fate.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I only did that as he was the least likely person
to be suspected,&quot; said the author easily. &quot;Jenny&mdash;that
is, Miss Paynton&mdash;wanted me to make Markham
commit the crime.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Markham is Jeringham,&quot; murmured Tait, under
his breath. &quot;Who committed the crime in the actual
case?&quot; he added aloud.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No one knows,&quot; answered Linton, shrugging his
shoulders. &quot;The case as related to me was a mystery.
I solved it after my own fashion.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In the third volume you trace the assassin by
means of a breastpin belonging to Michael Dene,&quot;
said Claude, again in favor. &quot;Is that fact or fiction?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Fiction! Miss Paynton invented the idea. She
said that as the dagger inculpated the woman the
breastpin found on the banks of the river would lead
to the detection of the man. And, as I worked it out,
the idea was a good one.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah!&quot; murmured Tait to himself, &quot;I wonder if
Mr. Hilliston had anything to do with a breastpin.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">By this time Linton was growing rather restive
under examination, as he was by no means pleased at
having to acknowledge his indebtedness to a woman&#39;s
wit. Seeing this Tait abruptly closed the conversation,
so as to avoid waking the suspicions of Linton.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A very interesting conversation,&quot; he said heartily.
&quot;I like to get behind the scenes and see the working
of a novelist&#39;s brain. We will say good-by now.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>[pg&nbsp;123]</span>
Linton, and I hope you will call at the Manor House
next week, when we will all three be at Thorston.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Delighted, I&#39;m sure,&quot; replied the author, and
thereupon melted into the crowd, leaving Claude and
Tait looking at one another.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; said the former, after a pause, &quot;we have
not learned much.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;On the contrary, I think we have learned a great
deal,&quot; said Tait, raising his eyebrows. &quot;We know
that Linton got the whole story from Jenny Paynton,
and that Mr. Hilliston is in possession of the knowledge.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What use can it be to him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He will try and frustrate us with Miss Paynton, as
he did Mrs. Bezel with you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you still doubt him?&quot; asked Claude angrily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Tait coolly, &quot;I still doubt him.&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="chXVI" id="chXVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<p class="h3">A FALSE MOVE.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> next day the two young men repaired to the
club for the purpose of having luncheon and discussing
their plans. Contrary to the wish of Claude, his
friend did not deem it advisable to at once depart for
Thorston, as he wished to remain in town for a few
days on business connected with Hilliston.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You see, you are quite in the dark regarding that
gentleman,&quot; said Tait, as they lighted their cigarettes
after dinner, &quot;and before we commence operations at
Thorston it will be advisable to know that he is not
counteracting our efforts.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In that case you had better go down to Thorston
and I will remain in town so as to keep an eye on
Hilliston.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t think that will be necessary,&quot; replied Tait
reflectively, &quot;it is more than probable that Hilliston
will visit Thorston.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For what purpose?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can&#39;t you guess? Last night he learned from Linton
that Jenny Paynton supplied the material for that
novel. Consequently he will see her, and, if possible,
find out where she heard the story.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; I suppose he will,&quot; said Claude thoughtfully.
&quot;By the way, who is Miss Paynton, who now seems to
be mixed up in the matter?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>[pg&nbsp;125]</span>
&quot;She is the daughter of an old recluse called Ferdinand
Paynton.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A recluse! Humph! That&#39;s strange.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why so? You would not say so if you saw the old
man. He is an invalid and lives in his library. A
charming companion, though I must say he is rather
sad.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where does he live?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;At Thorston, half a mile from the Manor House.
Not very rich, I should think. His cottage is small, like
his income.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And his daughter lives with him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. A pretty girl she is, who inherits his literary
tastes. It is my impression that she wrote the most
part of that novel. From all I know of Frank Linton
he is given more to poetry than to prose. Jenny has
the brain, not Frank.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ho, ho!&quot; said Claude, smiling. &quot;Is it the skeptical
misogynistic Tait I hear speaking?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Himself. I admit that I do not care for women, as
a rule, but there are exceptions to every rule, and in
this case Jenny Paynton is the exception.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is she in love with our author?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No. But I rather think he is in love with her, as
you will be when you see her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I! What are you talking about, Tait? I have more
to do than to fall in love with country wenches, however
pretty.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jenny is not a country wench,&quot; said Tait, with
some displeasure; &quot;she is a highly educated young
woman.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Worse and worse! I hate highly educated bluestockings.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>[pg&nbsp;126]</span>
&quot;You won&#39;t hate Jenny, at all events. Especially
as it is probable you will see a great deal of her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No; I shall keep away from her,&quot; said Claude
doggedly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s impossible. We must maneuver to get at
the truth. By asking her straight out she certainly
will not gratify our curiosity. We must plot and plan,
and take her unawares. She is not a fool, like Linton,
remember.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What! Do you call a lion of the season by so
opprobrious a name?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do,&quot; replied Tait serenely; &quot;because I don&#39;t
believe he wrote the book.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well! well! Never mind Linton. We have
pumped him dry. The next thing is to tackle the fair
Jenny. How do you intend to set about it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can&#39;t say, at present. We must be guided by
circumstances. I will introduce you to the rector and
to Mr. Paynton. There will be musical parties and
lawn tennis <i>fêtes</i>, so in some way or another we may
find out the truth?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Does anyone else live with Paynton; his wife, for
instance.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No. His wife died before he came to Thorston,
where he has been for a long time. An old servant
called Kerry lives with him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Man or woman?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Man. A queer old fellow, rather morose.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;H&#39;m! A flattering description. By the way, he
bears the same name as the ancient retainer in
Boucicault&#39;s play.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why shouldn&#39;t he?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It may be an assumed name.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>[pg&nbsp;127]</span>
Tait threw a surprised glance at his friend, and
laughed quickly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who is suspicious now?&quot; said he, smiling. &quot;You
blame me for suspecting Hilliston, yet here you are
doubtful of people whom you have never seen.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Before Larcher could answer this home thrust, a
waiter entered with a letter for him which had just
arrived.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;From Hilliston,&quot; said Claude, recognizing the
writing. &quot;I wonder what he has to say?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s only another move in the game,&quot; murmured
Tait; then as Claude, after glancing at the letter,
uttered an ejaculation of surprise, he added: &quot;What
is the matter?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hilliston is going down to Eastbourne.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Impossible!&quot; cried Tait, holding out his hand for
the letter. &quot;He is surely not so clumsy as to show
his hand so plainly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He does, though. Read the letter yourself.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;<span class="smcap">My Dear Claude</span> [wrote Hilliston]: Mrs. Hilliston
has decided to leave town for Eastbourne this
week, so it is probable we will see you and Mr. Tait
down there. If you can spare the time come to dinner
at half-past seven to-night, and tell me how you are
getting on with your case.</p>

<p class="center">  &quot;Yours very sincerely,</p>

<p class="right">  &quot;<span class="smcap">Francis Hilliston</span>.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; said Claude, as Tait silently returned the
letter, &quot;what do you think?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think that Hilliston intends to look up Jenny
Paynton.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>[pg&nbsp;128]</span>
&quot;I can see that,&quot; replied Claude impatiently, &quot;but
touching this invitation to dinner.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Accept.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I promised to see my mother to-night, and tell
her about John Parver. She will expect me, as I have
written.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will take your apologies to her,&quot; said Tait
quietly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. Listen to me, Claude,&quot; continued the little
man in a tone of suppressed excitement. &quot;You will
keep your belief in Hilliston. I tell you he is your
enemy and wishes you to leave this case alone. To-night
he will make one last attempt to dissuade you.
If he succeeds he will not go to Eastbourne. If he
fails you can depend on it he will try and see Jenny
before we do. Now, to thwart his aims we will go down
to Thorston by an early train to-morrow morning.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I must see my mother before I leave town.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No! I will tell her all she wishes to know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She might not like it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This is not a case for likes or dislikes,&quot; said Tait
grimly; &quot;but a question of getting the better of Hilliston.
You must dine with him to-night, and find out,
if possible, if it was his wife or himself who suggested
this visit to Eastbourne. You need not tell him we
go down to-morrow. Say you don&#39;t know&mdash;that you
await my decision. Try and learn all you can of his
attitude and plans. Then we will discuss the matter
when you return. On my part,&quot; continued Tait significantly,
&quot;I may have some something to say about
your mother.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You want to see her?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>[pg&nbsp;129]</span>
&quot;Yes. I am extremely anxious to see her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps you suspect her!&quot; cried Claude, in a fiery
tone.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bless the man, what a temper he has!&quot; said Tait
jocosely. &quot;I don&#39;t suspect anyone except Hilliston.
But I am quicker than you, and I wish to learn precisely
what your mother has to say. A chance remark
on her part may set us on the right path.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I will be guided by you,&quot; said Claude, in a
few minutes. &quot;You can go to Hampstead, and I will
dine with Hilliston. But I don&#39;t like the task. To sit
at a man&#39;s table and scheme against him is not my
idea of honor.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nor is it mine. You are doing no such thing.
All I wish you to do is to observe Hilliston&#39;s attitude
and hold your tongue. There is nothing wrong in
that. I want to find out his motive for this behavior.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then why not see him yourself!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will see him at Thorston. Meantime it is necessary
that I become acquainted with your mother.
Now come and wire an acceptance to Hilliston, and
write a letter to your mother for me to deliver.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Claude obeyed. He was quite content to accept the
guidance of Tait in this matter, and began to think
that his friend was right in suspecting Hilliston. Else
why did the lawyer&#39;s plans so coincide with their own.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mind you don&#39;t tell Hilliston too much,&quot; said
Tait, when the wire was despatched.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall tell him that we go to Thorston shortly,
and that we saw John Parver.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No; don&#39;t tell him about John Parver. He will
be certain to mention the subject first.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, and if he does&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>[pg&nbsp;130]</span>
&quot;Oh, you must use your brains,&quot; replied Tait ironically.
&quot;Baffle his curiosity, and above all, make no
mention of the breastpin episode related in the third
volume.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why not?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because Jenny Paynton told Linton of that. She
could not have obtained it from the newspapers, as it
is not related therein.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is pure invention.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No! I believe it to be a fact.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But who could have told it to Miss Paynton?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah!&quot; said Tait, in a low tone. &quot;Find me the
person who told her that and I&#39;ll find the man who
murdered your father.&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="chXVII" id="chXVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<p class="h3">THE HUSBAND AT KENSINGTON GORE.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">To</span> a woman who rules by right of beauty it is a
terrible thing to see her empire slipping from her
grasp by reason of gray hairs and wrinkles. What
desperate efforts does she make to protract her sway,
how she dyes and paints and powders and tight laces&mdash;all
to no end, for Time is stronger than Art, and finally
he writes his sign-manual too deep to be effaced by
cosmetics. Mrs. Hilliston was not yet beaten in the
fight with the old enemy, but she foresaw the future
when she would be shamed and neglected close at
hand.</p>

<p class="indent">Perhaps it was this premonition of defeat that made
her so unamiable, sharp, and bitter on the night when
Claude came to dine. She liked Claude and had stood
in the place of a mother to him; but he was a man, and
handsome, so when she saw his surprised look at her
changed appearance all the evil that was in her came
to the surface.</p>

<p class="indent">Yet she need not have felt so bitter a pang, had she
taken the trouble to glance at her image in the near
mirror. It reflected a tall, stylish figure, which, in the
dim light of the drawing room, looked majestic and
beautiful. It was all very well to think that she
appeared barely thirty in the twilight, but she knew
well that the daylight showed up her forty-seven years
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>[pg&nbsp;132]</span>
in the most merciless manner. Velvet robes, diamond
necklaces, and such like aids to beauty would not
make up for lack of youth, and Claude&#39;s ill-advised
start brought this home to her.</p>

<p class="indent">Ten years before she had married Hilliston in utter
ignorance of the house at Hampstead. Though she
did not know it she was not unlike her rival. There
was the same majesty, the same imperious beauty, the
same passionate nature, but Mrs. Bezel was worn and
wasted by illness, whereas Mrs. Hilliston, aided by art,
looked a rarely beautiful woman.</p>

<p class="indent">People said she had not done well to marry Hilliston.
She was then a rich widow from America, and wanted
to take a position in society. With her looks and her
money, she might have married a title, but handsome
Hilliston crossed her path, and, though he was then
fifty years of age, she fell in love with him on the spot.
Wearied of Mrs. Bezel, anxious to mend his failing
fortunes, Hilliston accepted the homage thus offered.
He did not love her, but kept that knowledge to himself,
so Mrs. Derrick, the wealthy widow, secured the
man she idolized. She gave all, wealth, beauty, love,
and received nothing in return.</p>

<p class="indent">During all their married life her love had undergone
no abatement. She loved her husband passionately,
and her one object in life was to please him. At the
time of the marriage she had rather resented the
presence of Claude in Hilliston&#39;s house, but soon
accepted him as an established fact, the more so as
he took up his profession shortly afterward, and left
her to reign alone over the heart of her husband.
When the young man called she was always kind to
him, she constantly looked after his welfare, and playfully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>[pg&nbsp;133]</span>
styled herself his mother. Claude was greatly
attached to her, and spoke of her in the highest terms,
but for the life of him he could not suppress that start,
though he knew it wounded her to the heart. During
his five years of absence she had aged greatly, and art
seemed rather to accentuate than conceal the truth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You find me altered, I am afraid,&quot; said she bitterly;
&quot;age is robbing me of my looks.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;By no means,&quot; answered Claude, with a desire to
please her; &quot;at the worst, you are only growing old
gracefully.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Small comfort in that,&quot; sighed Mrs. Hilliston.
&quot;I do not want to grow old at all. However, it is no
use fighting the inevitable, but I hope I&#39;ll die before I
become a hag.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You will never become one.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m not so sure of that. I&#39;m one of those large
women who turn to bones and wrinkles in old age.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In my eyes you will always be beautiful, Louise,&quot;
said Hilliston, who entered at this moment. &quot;You
are an angel ever bright and fair.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have not lost the art of saying pretty things,
Francis,&quot; replied his wife, greatly gratified; &quot;but
there is the gong. Claude, take your mother in to
dinner.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The young man winced as she said this, thinking of
his real mother who lay sick and feeble at Hampstead.
Hilliston saw his change of countenance, and bit his
lip to prevent himself remarking thereon. He guessed
what Claude was thinking about, and thus his thoughts
were turned in the same direction. At the present
moment the memories thus evoked were most
unpleasant.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>[pg&nbsp;134]</span>
During dinner Mrs. Hilliston recovered her spirits
and talked freely enough. No one was present save
Claude and her husband, so they were a very pleasant
party of three. While in the full flow of conversation,
Claude could not help thinking that Tait was unjust to
suspect the master of the house of underhand dealings;
for Hilliston was full of smiles and geniality, and did his
best to entertain his guest. Could Claude have looked
below the surface he would have been considerably
astonished at the inward aspect of the man. Yet a
hint was given him of such want of concord, for
Hilliston showed the cloven hoof before the meal
ended.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So you are going to Eastbourne,&quot; said Claude,
addressing himself to Mrs. Hilliston. &quot;I hope you
will come over to Thorston during your stay.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is not unlikely,&quot; replied the lady. &quot;Francis
intends to make excursions all round the country.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Only for your amusement, my dear,&quot; said Hilliston
hastily. &quot;You know how dreary it is to pace
daily up and down that Parade.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think Eastbourne is dreary, in any case. It is
solely on your account that I am going.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hilliston did not answer, but stole a glance at
Claude to see what he thought. The face of the
young man was inscrutable, though Claude was mentally
considering that Tait was right, and Hilliston&#39;s
journey to Eastbourne was undertaken to interview
Jenny Paynton.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t like your English watering-places,&quot; continued
Mrs. Hilliston idly. &quot;They are so exasperatingly
dull. In America we can have a good time at
Newport, but all your south coast is devoid of amusement.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>[pg&nbsp;135]</span>
Trouville or Dieppe are more enjoyable than
Eastbourne or Folkestone.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The fault of the national character, my dear
Louise. We English take our pleasures sadly, you
know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For the sole purpose of seeing what effect it would
produce on the lawyer Claude purposely introduced the
name of the town where his father had met his death.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wonder you don&#39;t try an inland watering-place,
Mrs. Hilliston,&quot; he said calmly; &quot;Bath or Tunbridge
Wells or&mdash;Horriston.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hilliston looked up quickly, and then busied himself
with his food. Discomposed as he was, his iron will
enabled him to retain a quiet demeanor; but the effect
of the name on the wife was more pronounced than it
was on the husband. Her color went, and she laid
down her knife and fork.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, I don&#39;t know Horriston,&quot; she said faintly.
&quot;Some inland&mdash;&mdash;Ah, how hot this room is. Open
the window,&quot; she added to the footman, &quot;we want
fresh air.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Rather astonished at the effect thus produced,
Claude would have spoken but that Hilliston forestalled
him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The room is hot,&quot; he said lightly, &quot;but the fresh
air will soon revive you, Louise. I am glad we are
going to Eastbourne, for you sadly need a change.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The season has been rather trying,&quot; replied his
wife, resuming her dinner. &quot;What were you saying
about Horriston, Claude?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing. I only know it is a provincial town set
in beautiful scenery. I thought you might wish to
try a change from the fashionable seaside place.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>[pg&nbsp;136]</span>
&quot;I might go there if it is pretty,&quot; answered Mrs.
Hilliston, who was now perfectly composed. &quot;Where is
Horriston?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In Kent,&quot; interposed Hilliston quickly, &quot;not very
far from Canterbury. I have been there myself, but
as it is a rather dull neighborhood, I would not advise
you to try it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Despite her denial Claude felt certain that Mrs.
Hilliston was acquainted with Horriston, for on the
plea of indisposition she left the table before the dinner
was ended. As she passed through the door she playfully
tipped Claude on the shoulder with her fan.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t forget to come and see us at Eastbourne,&quot;
she said vivaciously, &quot;and bring Mr. Tait with you.
He is a great favorite of mine.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This Claude promised to do, and, when she left the
room, returned to his seat with a rather puzzled
expression on his face. Hilliston saw the look, and
endeavored to banish it by a hasty explanation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You rather startled my wife by mentioning Horriston,&quot;
he said, in an annoyed tone. &quot;I wish you
had not done so. As it is connected with the case
she naturally feels an antipathy toward it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What! Does Mrs. Hilliston know about my
father&#39;s death?&quot; asked Claude, in some surprise.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. When we married, she wanted to know why
you lived in the house with me, so I was forced to
explain all the circumstances.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you think that was necessary?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do. You know how suspicious women are,&quot;
replied Hilliston lightly; &quot;they will know the truth.
But you can trust to her discretion, Claude. No one
will hear of it from her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>[pg&nbsp;137]</span>
At this moment a footman entered the room with a
message from Mrs. Hilliston.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My mistress wants to know if you have the third
volume of &#39;A Whim of Fate,&#39; sir?&quot; said the servant.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; replied Hilliston sharply. &quot;Tell your mistress
that I took it to my office by mistake. She will
have it to-morrow.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Claude thought this strange, and when the footman
retired Hilliston made another explanation equally
as unsatisfactory as the first.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am so interested in that book that I could not
leave it at home,&quot; he said quickly; &quot;and now that I
have met the author I am doubly interested in it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Another proof of Tait&#39;s acumen. Hilliston was the
first to introduce the subject of John Parver.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>[pg&nbsp;138]</span></p>

<h2><a name="chXVIII" id="chXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<p class="h3">A DUEL OF WORDS.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">A longish</span> pause ensued between the two men.
Hilliston seemed to be in no hurry to continue the
conversation, and Claude, with his eyes fixed absently
on his glass, pondered over the facts that Mrs. Hilliston
had an aversion to Horriston, and that the lawyer
had taken the third volume of the novel out of the
house. The two facts seemed to have some connection
with each other, but what the connection might be
Claude could not rightly conclude.</p>

<p class="indent">From his frequent talks with Tait he knew that the
third volume contained the episode of the scarfpin,
which was instrumental in bringing the fictitious
murderer to justice. The assassin in the novel was
meant for Hilliston, and remembering this Claude
wondered whether there might not be some reason
for his removal of the book. Mrs. Hilliston had
quailed at the mention of Horriston, and the explanation
given by her husband did not satisfy Larcher.
What reason could she have for taking more than
a passing interest in the tragic story? Why, after ten
years, should she pale at the mention of the neighborhood?
Claude asked himself these two questions,
but could find no satisfactory answer to either of
them.</p>

<p class="indent">He was toying with his wineglass while thinking,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>[pg&nbsp;139]</span>
when a sudden thought made him grip the slender
stem with spasmodic force. Was it possible that
Mrs. Hilliston could have been in the neighborhood
five-and-twenty years before; that she could have
heard some talk of that scarfpin which was not
mentioned at the trial, but which Tait insisted was an
actual fact, and no figment of the novelist&#39;s brain;
and finally, could it be that Hilliston had purposely
removed the third volume of &quot;A Whim of Fate&quot; so
that his wife should not have her memory refreshed
by a relation of the incident. It was very strange.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus thinking, Claude glanced stealthily at his
guardian, who was musingly smoking his cigar, and
drinking his wine. He looked calm, and content, and
prosperous. Nevertheless, Claude was by no means
so sure of his innocence as he had been. Hilliston&#39;s
confusion, his hesitation, his evasion, instilled doubts
into the young man&#39;s mind. He determined to gain
a knowledge of the truth by questions, and mentally
arranged these as follows: First he would try and learn
somewhat of the past of Mrs. Hilliston, for, beyond
the fact that she was an American, he knew nothing
of it. Second, he would lead Hilliston to talk of the
scarfpin, and see if the reference annoyed him; and,
third, he would endeavor to discover if the lawyer was
averse to his wife reading the novel. With his plans
thus cut and dried, he spoke abruptly to his guardian:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am sorry Mrs. Hilliston&#39;s health is so bad.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is not bad, my dear fellow,&quot; replied the lawyer,
lifting his head. &quot;She is a very strong woman; but
of course, the fatigue of a London season tells on the
healthiest constitution. That is why I wish her to go
to Eastbourne.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>[pg&nbsp;140]</span>
&quot;Why not take her to Horriston?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why should I? She connects the place with the
story of your father, about whom I was forced to speak
ten years ago; and, speaking personally, I have no
desire to return there, and recall the horrors of the
past.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You were greatly affected by my father&#39;s death?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Naturally; he was my dearest friend. I would
have given anything to discover the assassin.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did Mrs. Hilliston give you her opinion as to who
was guilty?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No. I told her as little as I could of so painful a
subject. She is not in possession of all the facts.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;At that rate why let her read &#39;A Whim of Fate&#39;?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t wish her to read it,&quot; answered Hilliston
quietly; &quot;but I left the novel lying about, and she
read the first two volumes. If I can help it, she shall
not finish the story.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why object to her reading the third volume?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because it would recall the past too vividly to her
mind.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hardly follow you there,&quot; said Claude, with a
keen look. &quot;The fact to which you refer cannot
exist for your wife. To her the novel can only be a
second telling of the story related by you, when she
wished to know who I was.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is very true. Nevertheless, it made so painful
an impression on her excitable nature that I am
unwilling that her memory should be refreshed.
Take another glass of wine, my boy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hilliston evidently wished to turn the conversation,
but Claude was too determined on learning the truth
to deviate from his course. Slowly filling his glass
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>[pg&nbsp;141]</span>
with claret he pushed the jug toward Hilliston, and
pursued his questioning:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The American nature is rather excitable, isn&#39;t it?
By the way, is Mrs. Hilliston a pure-blooded Yankee?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Hilliston, with suspicious promptitude;
&quot;she was a Chicago belle, and married a millionaire in
the pork line called Derrick. He died soon after the
marriage, so she came to England and married me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was her first visit to England, no doubt.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Her first visit,&quot; replied Hilliston gravely. &quot;All
her former life was passed in New York, Boston, and
Chicago. But what odd questions you ask,&quot; added
the lawyer, in a vexed tone. &quot;Surely you do not
think that my wife was at Horriston twenty-five years
ago, or that she knows aught of this crime save what
I have told her?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course, I think nothing of the sort,&quot; said
Larcher hastily, and what is more he believed what
he said. It was impossible that Mrs. Hilliston,
American born and bred, who had only been in England
twelve years, should know anything of an obscure
crime committed in a dull provincial town thirteen
years before the date of her arrival. Hitherto his
questionings had eventuated in little, so he turned the
conversation into another groove, and tried to learn
if Hilliston knew anything of Jenny Paynton.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you think of John Parver?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He seemed an intelligent young fellow. Is that
his real name?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No. His name is Frank Linton, the son of the
vicar of Thorston.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What! He belongs to the place whither you go
with Tait,&quot; exclaimed Hilliston, with a startled air.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>[pg&nbsp;142]</span>
&quot;That is strange. You may learn there whence he
obtained the materials for his novel.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know that. He obtained them from Miss
Paynton.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who is she?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A literary young lady who lives at Thorston with
her folks. But I fancy Linton mentioned that he had
told you about her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well he did and he didn&#39;t,&quot; said Hilliston, in some
confusion; &quot;that is, he admitted that the story was
founded on fact, but he did not tell me whence he
obtained such facts. I suppose it is your intention to
question this young lady.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. I want to know how she heard of the
matter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pooh! Read it in a provincial newspaper, no
doubt.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think not,&quot; replied Claude, with some point.
&quot;It is next to impossible that she should come across
a paper containing an account of the trial. People
don&#39;t keep such grewsome matters by them, unless
they have an interest in doing so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, this young lady cannot be one of those persons.
How old is she?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Four-and-twenty!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah!&quot; said Hilliston with a sigh of relief, &quot;she
was not born when your father was murdered. You
must see she can know nothing positive of the matter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then how did she supply Linton with the materials
for this book?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can only answer that question by reverting to my
theory of the newspaper.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, even granting that it is so,&quot; said Larcher
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>[pg&nbsp;143]</span>
quickly, &quot;she knows details of the case which are not
set forth in the newspaper.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How do you know this?&quot; asked Hilliston, biting
his lip to control his feelings.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because in the third volume&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nonsense! nonsense!&quot; interrupted Hilliston violently,
&quot;you seem to forget that the hard facts of the
case have been twisted and turned by the novelist&#39;s
brain. We do not know who slew your father, but the
novelist had to end his story,&mdash;he had to solve the
mystery,&mdash;and he has done so after his own fashion.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Rising from his seat, he paced hurriedly to and fro,
talking the while with an agitation strange in so hard
and self-controlled a man.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For instance, the character of Michael Dene is
obviously taken from me. It is not a bit like me, of
course, either in speech, or looks, or dress. All the
novelist knew was that I had given evidence at the
trial, and that the dead man had been my dearest
friend. The circumstances suggested a striking dramatic
situation&mdash;that the dear friend had committed
the crime for the base love of the wife. Michael Dene
is guilty in the novel&mdash;but the man in real life, myself&mdash;&mdash;You
know all I know of the case. I would
give ten years of my life, short as the span now is, to
find the man who killed George Larcher.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This was strong speaking, and carried conviction to
the heart of Claude, the more so when Hilliston
further explained himself.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;On the night of the murder I was at the ball three
miles off. I knew nothing of the matter till I was
called upon to identify the corpse of your father. It
was hardly recognizable, and the face was much disfigured,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>[pg&nbsp;144]</span>
but I recognized him by the color of his hair
and the seal on his finger.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How was it that my father was dressed as
Darnley?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;John Parver explains that,&quot; said Hilliston sharply.
&quot;Jeringham&mdash;I forget his name in the novel&mdash;was
dressed as Darnley, and I believe, as is set forth in the
book, that George Larcher assumed the dress so that
under his mask your mother might mistake him for
Jeringham. Evidently she did so, as he learned that
she loved Jeringham&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;One moment,&quot; interposed Claude quickly, &quot;my
mother denies that Jeringham was her lover.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your mother?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mrs. Bezel.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;True; I forgot for the moment that you knew she
was alive. No doubt she is right; and Jeringham was
only her friend. But in the novel he is her lover;
Michael Dene, drawn from myself, is her lover. You
see fact and fiction are so mixed up that there is no
getting at the truth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall get at the truth,&quot; said Claude quietly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never. After such a lapse of time you can discover
nothing. Better let the dead past bury its dead.
I advised you before. I advise you now. You will
only torture your life, cumber it with a useless task.
George Larcher is dead and buried, and dust by this
time. No one knows who killed him, no one ever
shall know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am determined to learn the truth!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hope you may, but be advised. Leave this
matter alone. You do not know what misery you may
be laying up for yourself. Why, you have not even a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>[pg&nbsp;145]</span>
clew to start from! Unless,&quot; added Hilliston, with a
sneer, &quot;you follow the example of the novelist and
elucidate the mystery by means of the scarfpin.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Again Tait was right. Hilliston had himself introduced
the subject of the scarfpin. Claude immediately
took advantage of the opening.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose that episode is fiction?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course it is. No scarfpin was found in the
garden. Nothing was found but the dagger. You
know that Michael Dene is supposed to drop that scarfpin
on the spot. Well, I am the living representative
of Michael Dene, and I assure you I never owned a
garnet cross with a central diamond.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is that the description of the scarfpin?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. Do you not remember? A small Maltese
cross of garnets with a diamond in the center. The
description sounds fictitious. Who ever saw such an
ornament in real life. But in detective novels the
solution of the mystery turns on such gew-gaws. A
scarfpin, a stud, a link, a brooch&mdash;all these go to hang
a man&mdash;in novels.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This assertion that the episode of the scarfpin was
fiction was in direct contradiction to that of Tait, who
declared it to be true. Claude was torn by conflicting
doubts, but ultimately put the matter out of his
thoughts. Miss Paynton alone could give a correct
opinion as to whether it had emanated from her fertile
brain, or was really a link in the actual case. Judging
from the speech of Hilliston, and the silence of the
newspaper reports, Claude believed that Tait was
wrong.</p>

<p class="indent">The lawyer and his guest did not go to the drawing
room, as Mrs. Hilliston sent word that she was going
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>[pg&nbsp;146]</span>
to bed with a bad headache. Under the circumstances
Claude took his leave, having, as he thought, extracted
all necessary information from Hilliston. Moreover,
he was anxious to get back to Tait&#39;s chambers and
hear what the little man had to tell him about Mrs.
Bezel. Hilliston said good-by to him at the door.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall see you at Eastbourne, I suppose,&quot; he said
genially.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. I will drive over and tell you what Miss
Paynton says.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The door closed, and Hilliston, with a frown on his
face, stood looking at the floor. He was by no means
satisfied with the result of the interview.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wish I could stop him,&quot; he muttered, clenching
his fist; &quot;stop him at any price. If he goes on he will
learn the truth, and if he learns the truth&mdash;ah&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He drew a long breath, and went upstairs to his
wife. As he ascended the stairs it seemed to him as
though he heard the halting step of Nemesis following
stealthily behind.</p>

<h2><a name="chXIX" id="chXIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<p class="h3">TAIT BRINGS NEWS.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">As</span> quick as a fast hansom could take him, Claude
drove to Earls Street, and found Tait impatiently
waiting his arrival. The little man had a look of
triumph in his eyes, which showed that his interview
with Mrs. Bezel had been to some purpose. Dormer
had placed wine and biscuits on the table, and, made
hungry by his long journey to Hampstead, Tait was
partaking of these modest refreshments when Claude
entered the room.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thought you were never coming,&quot; said he, glancing
at his watch; &quot;past ten o&#39;clock. You must have
had an interesting conversation with Hilliston to stay
so long.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have had a very interesting conversation. And
you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I got back thirty minutes ago, after being
more than an hour with your mother.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Was she disappointed at my non-appearance?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very much so, but I explained that you had to
dine with Hilliston. She did not seem to like that
either.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Absurd! She thinks no end of Hilliston, and
advised me to see as much of him as possible.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nevertheless, the idea that you were dining with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>[pg&nbsp;148]</span>
him did not please her; I could only quiet her by telling
all I know about Mrs. Hilliston.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">When Tait made this remark Claude was taking off
his cloak, but he paused in doing so to ask a question.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What possible interest can my mother have in
Mrs. Hilliston?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know. But she asked me who she was, and
where she came from. Insisted on a description of
her looks, and altogether pumped me dry on the subject.
I suppose she wished to know something of
Hilliston&#39;s domestic felicity, and, as he has not enlightened
her on the subject, applied to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This explanation, which was accepted implicitly by
Claude, was by no means the truth. With his usual
sharpness Tait had noted Mrs. Bezel was profoundly
jealous of the lawyer&#39;s wife, and from this, and sundry
other hints, had drawn conclusions by no means flattering
to the lady herself. Still, as she was Claude&#39;s
mother, he had too much good breeding, and too much
liking for his friend, to state his belief&mdash;which was that
the bond between Mr. Hilliston and Mrs. Bezel was not
of so harmless a nature as they would have the world
believe.</p>

<p class="indent">With this idea in his head, Tait began to look at the
case from the point of view adopted by John Parver.
Might it not be true that Hilliston was the secret
lover of the wife and the murderer of the husband?
Certainly the efforts he was making to stay Claude in
solving the mystery gave color to the idea. If he were
innocent of crime and illicit passion he would surely
be anxious to hasten, instead of retarding, the discovery.
Tait&#39;s private opinion was that Hilliston had
the crime of murder on his soul, but for obvious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>[pg&nbsp;149]</span>
reasons, not unconnected with Mrs. Bezel, he did not
care to speak openly to Larcher. On the contrary,
while admitting a disbelief in the lawyer, he feigned
a doubt of his complicity in the matter which he was
far from feeling.</p>

<p class="indent">Under these circumstances he had advised Claude
to leave the matter alone, for he dreaded the effect on
his friend&#39;s mind when he learned the truth.</p>

<p class="indent">Whether Hilliston proved innocent or not, the
unraveling of the mystery would necessarily result
in the disclosure of the relations existing between him
and Mrs. Bezel. Tait shrank from pursuing investigations
likely to lead to such a result, but the determination
of Claude to avenge his father&#39;s murder
left him no option. Against his better judgment he
was urged along the path of discovery; but trusted
when the time came to soften the blow of the inevitable
result.</p>

<p class="indent">In silence he heard the story related by Claude of
the evening at Hilliston&#39;s, and did not comment on
the information thus given so speedily as Larcher
expected. He thought it wiser to delay any remarks
till he had told the young man of his interview with
Mrs. Bezel.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I need not go into details, Claude,&quot; he said, anxious
not to say too much, &quot;but will tell you as shortly
as I can. Mrs. Bezel&mdash;it is more convenient to speak
of her so than to call her your mother&mdash;is not pleased
that you should try and solve this mystery.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know that. She thinks it is hopeless, and is
unwilling that I should waste my time to no purpose.
But she should have thought of that before inducing
Hilliston to show me the paper. Now it is too late,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>[pg&nbsp;150]</span>
and for my own satisfaction, if not for hers, I must go
on with the matter. Did you relate our conversation
with Linton?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. And she takes the same view of it as Hilliston.
That Miss Paynton got the case from a bundle of
old newspapers.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you think yourself?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I still hold to my opinion,&quot; said Tait quietly.
&quot;The affair was related to Jenny by someone who
lived in Horriston at the time the murder took place.
Else she would never have given Linton that fact
about the scarfpin, which, as we know, is not mentioned
in the report of the trial.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hilliston says that the episode is fiction.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mrs. Bezel says it is fact.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What! Was a scarfpin of garnets really found in
the grounds of The Laurels?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was. Mrs. Bezel described the jewel to me, and
asserted that it was discovered near the bank of the
stream.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Does she know to whom it belonged?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No! She had no recollection of having seen it
before. Neither your father nor Jeringham wore a
scarfpin of that pattern.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is curious that Hilliston should insist that such
a pin never existed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is very curious,&quot; assented Tait significantly,
&quot;especially as it was shown to him by Denis Bantry.
This one fact ought to convince you that Hilliston is
playing us false.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My doubts were confirmed by his manner to-night,&quot;
replied Claude gloomily. &quot;I don&#39;t know what
his reason may be, or how I can reconcile his present
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>[pg&nbsp;151]</span>
behavior with his kindness to my mother, but he certainly
seems anxious to thwart us if he can.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tait guessed what the reason was very well, but was
too wise to explain himself. Granted that a bond
existed between Mrs. Bezel and the lawyer, and the
whole thing became clear, but Mrs. Bezel was Claude&#39;s
mother, so Tait held his peace.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why wasn&#39;t the scarfpin produced at the trial?&quot;
asked Claude, seeing his friend made no answer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Only one man can answer that question&mdash;Denis
Bantry.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Does my mother know where he is?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No. She has not set eyes on him since she left
Horriston.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is strange that he should have suppressed so
important a piece of evidence,&quot; said Claude meditatively,
&quot;devoted as he was to my father. I should
have thought he would have done his best to bring the
murderer to justice.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps he did not know who the murderer was.
However, there is no doubt that the scarfpin must
have told him something about which he judged it
wise to hold his tongue. Perhaps Miss Paynton can
enlighten us on the subject.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then she must know Denis Bantry.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So I think,&quot; said Tait thoughtfully. &quot;The
episode of the scarfpin was only known to your
mother, to Hilliston, and to Bantry. Jenny Paynton
does not know your mother, who denied all knowledge
of her. She cannot be acquainted with Hilliston, or
he certainly would not have let her make use of the
affair for Linton&#39;s book, even if he had told her.
There only remains Denis Bantry. Now, I know that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>[pg&nbsp;152]</span>
Jenny has lived all her life at Thorston, so if she saw
this man anywhere it must have been there.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is there anyone in the neighborhood you think is
he?&quot; asked Larcher, greatly excited.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;None that I can call to mind. But then, I don&#39;t
know the neighborhood very well. We must make a
thorough exploration of it when we are down there.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly. But it seems to me that the only one
who can put us in the right track is the girl.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;True enough. I only hope she will be amenable
to reason.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Larcher poured himself out a glass of wine and
drank it slowly. Then he lighted his pipe and returned
to his chair with a new idea in his head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wonder why Hilliston told that lie about the
scarfpin, Tait?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ask me something easier. I cannot say. We&#39;ll
learn nothing from him. My dear fellow, it is no use
asking further questions of your guardian or of your
mother. We have found out all from them that
we can. Nothing now remains but to see Jenny
Paynton.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Quite right. And we go to Thorston to-morrow?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;By the ordinary train. I have written for the
dogcart to meet us. By this time next week we may
know a great deal&mdash;we may know the truth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is, if Hilliston doesn&#39;t thwart us. He is going
down to Eastbourne, remember.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know. But I intend to get what the Americans
call the &#39;inside running,&#39; by seeing Jenny to-morrow
evening. The whole case turns on her explanation of
the scarfpin episode.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>[pg&nbsp;153]</span>
&quot;Well,&quot; said Claude, knocking the ashes out of his
pipe, &quot;we found Linton through his book, we found
Jenny through Linton. Through her we may find
Denis Bantry.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And through Denis Bantry we may find the man
who killed your father,&quot; finished Tait triumphantly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I know what the name of the man will be.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What will it be?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jeringham.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tait shrugged his shoulders. Knowing what he did
he was by no means certain on that point.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2><a name="chXX" id="chXX"></a>CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<p class="h3">A PRÉCIS OF THE CASE.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">A month</span> ago had anyone prophesied that I, Spenser
Tait, would be engaged in playing the part of an
amateur detective, I should have flatly contradicted
his prognostication. Yet here I am doing my best to
solve the mystery which hangs round the death of my
friend&#39;s father. I cannot say that I object to the task,
for there is something tremendously exciting in this
man hunt. My friendship for Claude is the principal
factor which induces me to meddle with the business;
but a slight flavoring of selfishness is also present.</p>

<p class="indent">Hitherto we had been fairly successful, and have at
least found a clew likely to lead to some certain result.
Between Mrs. Bezel, Hilliston, and Linton&#39;s book, we
have learned a good deal of the case; and all our
knowledge points to an interview with Jenny Paynton
as the next step to be taken.</p>

<p class="indent">To-morrow we start for Thorston for this purpose,
but before exploring the new field I judge it wise to
set down all the facts which have come to our knowledge,
and to deduce therefrom, if possible, a logical
reason for our future actions. I have my suspicions,
but these are vague and intangible. Claude has his
suspicions, but these do not coincide with mine. He
believes Jeringham to be guilty of the crime. I think
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>[pg&nbsp;155]</span>
Hilliston is likely to prove the assassin. Both of us
may be wrong.</p>

<p class="indent">To take the case of Mr. Hilliston. His attitude is
decidedly aggressive at the present moment, and he is
doing his best to dissuade Claude from investigating
the case. Why should he do so? George Larcher
was his dearest friend, and met with a cruel fate. If
there is any chance of his fate being avenged, surely
Hilliston should be the first to prosecute the inquiries.
Instead of doing so he hangs back, and throws cold
water on my efforts and on Claude&#39;s. He must have
some reason for his actions. Is that reason to be
found at Clarence Cottage in Hampstead?</p>

<p class="indent">This question brings me to a delicate point. My
work is hampered by the fact that Mrs. Bezel is
Claude&#39;s mother, and I dare not express myself as I
should wish. I gather from the report of the trial that
Mrs. Larcher was a vain and silly coquette, who threw
away the love of a good man for the indulgence of her
own selfish instincts. Guilty she may have been, but
not with Jeringham. If she had any lover, it was
Francis Hilliston. After a visit to Clarence Cottage
I believe the view taken of the case by the novelist to
be the right one.</p>

<p class="indent">During my interview with Mrs. Bezel I noted her
every look and action. When Hilliston&#39;s name occurred
she flushed up and looked savage; she was
anxious to know all about the wife at Kensington
Gore, and in every way showed that she had more
interest in the man than she cared to confess. Again,
she told me that her illness was of ten years&#39; duration.
Hilliston has been married ten years. What is more
likely than that he should have wearied of the invalid,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>[pg&nbsp;156]</span>
and so deserted her for Mrs. Derrick, the rich
widow.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Bezel is jealous of Hilliston and of his wife.
Her love has changed to hatred, and I verily believe
that she would harm him if she could. Already she
has attempted to do so, for it was only her threat to
reveal all to Claude that made Hilliston produce that
report of the Larcher affair. She has told me all she
knows, but I cannot help thinking that she is keeping
back certain facts connected with the case. There is
a hesitancy and doubt in her speech which points to
some secret. If I could learn that secret it might
establish the guilt of Hilliston.</p>

<p class="indent">And yet I cannot believe that. No woman, however
vain, however frivolous, would have lived with the man
who murdered her husband, who slew the father of
her child. Mrs. Bezel&#39;s secret may not directly inculpate
Hilliston, but it may point toward him as the possible
assassin. But I cannot believe that she thinks him
guilty. Their relations with one another forbids so
horrible a supposition.</p>

<p class="indent">Nevertheless, Hilliston is afraid of the truth coming
to light. He denies that the garnet scarfpin ever
existed, while Mrs. Bezel said she saw it herself. If
the lawyer is not afraid, why should he tell a deliberate
lie? It is his word against that of Mrs. Bezel, and
as her statement is backed up by the description in the
novel, I believe she is telling the truth. Can it be
possible that the scarfpin belonged to Hilliston and
was dropped by him in the garden of The Laurels
on the night of the struggle?</p>

<p class="indent">Here Hilliston proves an alibi. He stated to Claude
that at the hour of three o&#39;clock, when the crime was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>[pg&nbsp;157]</span>
presumably committed, he was at the ball in the
Horriston Town Hall. If that can be proved, he
must, perforce, be innocent.</p>

<p class="indent">Another supposition: Can Mrs. Larcher be actually
guilty of her husband&#39;s death, and, knowing this, is
Hilliston anxious to stop Claude in his investigations
lest he should learn so terrible a truth? I cannot
believe this, for Mrs. Larcher, or Bezel, set the ball
rolling herself, and were she guilty she certainly would
not have run such risk.</p>

<p class="indent">Then, again, Jeringham fled on the night of the
murder. For what reason? If Hilliston killed
Larcher why should Jeringham fly? If Mrs. Bezel
killed her husband why should Jeringham fly? I see
no reason in his flight, and yet if he were guilty and
Hilliston knew him to be guilty why should he try and
screen him at the present time? Altogether the case
is so confusing that I do not know what to think or
whom to suspect.</p>

<p class="indent">I wonder what has become of Mona Bantry and her
child? Mrs. Bezel said she had not seen the girl or
her brother for twenty-five years. Yet they must be
somewhere. Circumstances point to Jenny Paynton
having heard the story of the tragedy from Denis, for
no one else could have revealed the episode of the
scarfpin, or have described the jewel. If Denis told
her he must live at Thorston, and if he lives there his
sister must be with him. If this pair, who were in the
house on the night of the murder, can be found, the
truth may come to light.</p>

<p class="indent">After searching Thorston and finding out all I can
from the Bantrys,&mdash;presuming them to be there,&mdash;it is
my intention to go down to Horriston and find out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>[pg&nbsp;158]</span>
someone who remembers the case. In spite of the
lapse of time there must be some old people alive who
danced at that ball in their hot youth. They may be
able to say if George Larcher was there present in the
character of Darnley, and at what time Hilliston left
the ball. I may also hear what they think of Jeringham,
and of the conduct of Mrs. Bezel. In making
these investigations I shall not take Claude, as I
shrewdly suspect the opinions of these oldsters regarding
his mother are anything but flattering to that lady.
If I go to Horriston I must go alone.</p>

<p class="indent">On reading over these notes I am hardly satisfied
with them. They do not seem to give me much basis
on which to work. I suspect this person and the other,
but I have very little evidence to back me up in such
suspicions. The only thing that seems clear to me is
that Hilliston has some object in thwarting our plans.
What the object is I must find out. Perhaps I shall do
so at Thorston, where I am certain to meet both Hilliston
and his wife.</p>

<p class="indent">And that reminds me of what Claude related about
her emotion this evening. It is certainly curious, but
the worst of dabbling in detective business is that one
is apt to get over-suspicious. In this case I think
there is no ground for suspicion. Mrs. Hilliston is an
American, and came to England twelve years ago. I
know this for certain, for I remember when she made
her <i>début</i> in society. This being the case, she cannot
possibly have any connection with Horriston, and her
emotion must have been merely the recollection of the
story related by her husband when he told her of
Claude.</p>

<p class="indent">Well, it is past midnight, and I had better end these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>[pg&nbsp;159]</span>
unsatisfactory notes. Detective business is harder
than I thought. How am I to evolve order out of all
this chaos I hardly know, save to trust to luck and
Jenny Paynton. And so to bed, as saith worthy
Samuel Pepys.</p>

<h2><a name="chXXI" id="chXXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<p class="h3">THORSTON.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">It</span> is astonishing how closely one village resembles
another in appearance. The square-towered church,
the one winding street, the low-roofed inn, and red-tiled
cottages, isolated by narrow alleys; corn lands
and comfortable farms around, and still further the
mansions, more or less stately, of the county families.
Go where you will in the southern countries, all the
villages are so constituted; one description serves for
all, though on occasions the expanse of the Channel
introduces a new feature into the landscape. Thorston
was of the same class, but, in its own opinion, had
more pretentions to grandeur than its neighbors.</p>

<p class="indent">Before the Conquest it had been a considerable
Saxon town, and, as its name indicates, had flourished
before the introduction of Christianity into England.
There, according to tradition, a temple to Thor the
Thunderer had stood on the hill now crowned with
the church; hence the name of Thor&#39;s town. Report
said that Edward the Confessor had built the church,
but of his work little remained, and the present building
was due to the piety or fears of a Norman baron,
who wished to expiate his sins after the fashion of
those times, by erecting a house to some interceding
saint. In the present instance this church was dedicated
to St. Elfrida, the holy daughter of Athelstan,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>[pg&nbsp;161]</span>
who renounced her father&#39;s court to found a nunnery
by the winding river Lax, famous for salmon, as is
plainly hinted by its Scandinavian appellation. Yet
notwithstanding church and tradition, Thorston had
never since been of much importance, and it was now
but an ordinary rural village, quaint and sleepy.</p>

<p class="indent">From Eastbourne the road, winding, dipping, rising,
and curving like a white snake, ran over hill, through
dale, along plain, till it ultimately formed the High
Street of Thorston. Thence it ran again into the
country, but at this point it made its way between
houses, thatched and old; and toward the center
opened into a market-place adorned by an antique
cross. The Inn of St. Elfrida, with an effigy of the
saint for a sign, stood on the right of this square,
fronting the battered cross; directly opposite a narrow
road led on to the village green, at the end of which
rose the low hill whereon the Church of St. Elfrida
stood amid its trees. Lower down by the Lax could
be seen the ruins of her nunnery, and a well frequented
by her was to be inspected in the near neighborhood.
Here, said the legend, she fought with the devil, who
strove to carry away the tower of the church, and
being worsted, as the demons always were by Mother
Church, he dropped the tower a few yards off the main
building. As a matter of fact the square tower is
detached from the church, but, as has before been
stated, it was built by the Normans long after Elfrida
was laid to rest. But the legend took no account of
dates, nor did the natives of Thorston, who would have
been highly offended had anyone denied the authenticity
of their story. In confirmation thereof they
referred to the guide book&mdash;a notable authority truly.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>[pg&nbsp;162]</span>
The whole neighborhood was full of St. Elfrida, who
must have been a busy saint in her day, and numerous
tourists came to view church, and tower, and holy
well. The village derived quite an income from her
reputation, and valued the saint accordingly. Amid
ancient oaks stood the gray church with its detached
tower; around lichened tombstones leaned over one
another, and rank grass grew up to the verge of the
low stone wall which ran like a battlement round the
crest of the little hill. A flight of rugged steps led up
to the lych-gate, and here stood a pretty girl in converse
with Frank Linton, alias John Parver.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a hot summer&#39;s day, and the golden light,
piercing through the foliage of the trees, enveloped
the girl in a glittering haze. She was extremely
pretty; dark-eyed, dark-haired, with a complexion of
roses and lilies, and as neat a figure as was ever seen.
Envious people said that Miss Paynton pinched her
waist, but such was not the case, for she was too
careless of her appearance, and too careful of her
health, to sacrifice the latter to the former. As a
matter of fact, she appreciated brains more than
beauty, and much preferred to exercise the first in
clever conversation than to be complimented on the
second. Linton, who had known her for many years,
skillfully combined the two modes of paying homage
to his divinity. That he received hard words in
return was to be expected, for Jenny knew her power
over the youth, and liked to exercise it. She was the
least vain of mortals, but could not hide from herself
that she was clever and pretty, and therefore entitled
to indulge in coquetry.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You grow more beautiful every day, Jenny,&quot; said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>[pg&nbsp;163]</span>
Linton, who had lately arrived from town and was
making up for lost time.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you more stupid,&quot; retorted Miss Paynton,
climbing up on the low wall, where she sat and smiled
at him from under her straw hat. &quot;If you have come
here to pay me compliments you can go away again.
I want you to talk sense, not nonsense.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What shall I talk about?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As if there were any question of that,&quot; said she, in
supreme disdain. &quot;Are you not famous now? Tell
me of your success.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You know about it already. I sent you all the
papers. &#39;A Whim of Fate,&#39; is the book of the
season.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, just think of that now! Oh, lucky, lucky
Frank! So young and so successful. You ought to
be happy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am happy, because I now see a chance of making
you my&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now you are talking nonsense,&quot; cried Jenny, ruthlessly
interrupting him. &quot;I won&#39;t hear a word more,
you ridiculous boy. You are my brother, nothing
more.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t talk about it, Frank. Be sensible. Come
now, you have not yet told me how your father
received the news.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, he is pleased, of course,&quot; said Linton, unwillingly
changing the subject; &quot;but he reserves his
opinion till he has read the book. If he doesn&#39;t like
it he&#39;ll very likely order me to stop writing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m sure he won&#39;t,&quot; said Jenny promptly.
&quot;You&#39;ll make more as an author than as a lawyer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>[pg&nbsp;164]</span>
&quot;No doubt, if you continue to supply me with such
excellent plots. I wish I had your invention, Jenny.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was not invention. You know that quite well.
I found an account of the trial in an old bundle of
provincial newspapers. I couldn&#39;t have made up such
a story.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jenny,&quot; asked Linton, with some apprehension,
&quot;has your father read the book?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No; I asked him to do so, but he refuses to read
novels. History is what he likes&mdash;kings and dates,
and battles. Father wouldn&#39;t waste a minute over
fiction.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hope he won&#39;t be angry at your giving me the
plot, Jenny.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Paynton stared at him in surprise, and burst
into a merry laugh. His objection seemed supremely
ridiculous to her at that moment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear boy, why should he? The account of an
old murder case can have nothing to do with him. I
found the papers in the garret among a heap of old
books. I don&#39;t suppose he knows of their existence.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was a real case, wasn&#39;t it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; it took place at Horriston in 1866. But of
course the public need not know that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I told someone about it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, you are an idiot, Frank; or else,&quot; added
Jenny more graciously, &quot;you are very honest. I
suppose you explained that the story was founded on
fact?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who asked you about it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Three people. An old gentleman, and two young
men.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>[pg&nbsp;165]</span>
&quot;What are their names?&quot; asked Jenny curiously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I forget. The third one was called Tait, I think,
but I don&#39;t remember the names of the other two. It
doesn&#39;t matter, you know,&quot; continued the novelist
hastily; &quot;lots of authors found their plots on episodes
in real life.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, it&#39;s of no consequence,&quot; said Jenny idly. &quot;I
suppose they thought the plot was too clever for you
to invent. At all events the credit is due to you for
solving the mystery.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah! But did I solve it properly? Do you think
Michael Dene committed the crime?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I don&#39;t!&quot; rejoined Jenny promptly. &quot;I think
Jeringham did.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jeringham. Who is he?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I forgot,&quot; said Jenny, with some dismay, &quot;I did
not tell you the real names of the people. Jeringham
is the man you call Markham in the book. If you
remember, I wanted you to make him commit the
crime.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If I had done so no one would have read the book,&quot;
protested the author. &quot;His flight made it so patent
that he was guilty; and I had to put the crime on to
someone like Dene, whom no reader would suspect.
Do you think that Markham&mdash;Jeringham really committed
the murder?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I do. If he was innocent why did he fly?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Was he ever found again,&quot; asked Linton, with
some curiosity.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never! It is five-and-twenty years ago since the
murder was committed, and it is a mystery to this
day.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;d like to read that newspaper report for myself,&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>[pg&nbsp;166]</span>
said the author, after a pause. &quot;Could you not let
me see it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jenny shook her head. &quot;I&#39;m afraid not,&quot; she
replied guiltily. &quot;You see Kerry found me with
the papers one day and took them away. He was
very angry, and said I had no business to look at
them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My stars!&quot; cried Linton, in a startled tone; &quot;what
will he say when he finds out that you and I have made
use of them?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He won&#39;t find out,&quot; replied Jenny, jumping down
off the wall. &quot;Kerry never reads novels, and no one
will tell him. Oh, it&#39;s quite safe, Frank, quite safe.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m not so sure of that, Jenny. My father will
talk about my book to Mr. Paynton, and he&#39;ll tell
Kerry.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, what if he does,&quot; cried Jenny, skipping down
the steps. &quot;I&#39;m sure I don&#39;t care if Kerry does know.
Who cares for a musty, fusty old crime of five-and-twenty
years ago? Don&#39;t trouble about it, Frank. I&#39;ll
take the blame.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Linton walked on in silence beside her, and they
entered the market place on their way to the vicarage,
He was beginning to have some qualms about the
matter. Kerry had a very bad temper, and Linton
was by no means anxious to encounter him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wish we had left it alone,&quot; he said gloomily,
pausing by the cross in the square.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nonsense! Don&#39;t be a moral coward,&quot; said Jenny
pettishly. &quot;I&#39;ll take the blame on myself. Kerry
can&#39;t kill me be&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At this point she was interrupted by a dog-cart
containing two young men, which spun past rapidly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>[pg&nbsp;167]</span>
The driver took off his hat to Miss Paynton with a
smile.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh!&quot; said Jenny composedly, when the vehicle
had vanished, &quot;there is our new Lord of the Manor,
Mr. Tait.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, those are the two fellows who questioned
me about my story!&quot; cried Linton.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are they? Yes, you mentioned the name of
Tait,&quot; said Jenny quietly; &quot;but what does it matter?
What a fuss you make over nothing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jenny,&quot; said Linton solemnly, &quot;there is going
to be trouble over that story.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Paynton stared at him in surprise, then pointed
an accusing finger at him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Francis Linton,&quot; she said slowly, &quot;you are a silly
fool. If ever I help you again in your writing, I give
you leave to marry me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then she ran away and left him dumfounded in
the market place. But she was by no means so light-hearted
as she appeared to be. Kerry&#39;s anger, the
questions of the two strangers, made her feel uneasy,
and she thought it would have been better had she
left the provincial newspapers in the garret. But
Fate decided otherwise, and Jenny Paynton, though
she knew it not, was an unconscious instrument to
revive interest in a forgotten case, to solve a mystery
of five-and-twenty years, and to bring an unknown
criminal to justice. Life is a chess board, we are the
puppets, and Fate plays the game.</p>

<h2><a name="chXXII" id="chXXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

<p class="h3">IN THE CHURCH.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Thorston Manor</span>, built in broad meadow land,
about a quarter of a mile from the village, was now
the property of Spencer Tait. He had purchased it
lately at a small price from old Miss Felcar, the last
representative of that ancient family. She, unable to
maintain the house in its original splendor, got quit of
it altogether in this way, and shortly afterward took
up her quarters at Eastbourne, leaving the house of
her ancestors in the possession of a stranger.</p>

<p class="indent">The house itself was of no great pretensions, or age,
dating only from the second George&mdash;a square, red-brick
mansion, only redeemed from actual ugliness by
the mellow beauty of its hues. The grounds themselves
were better, and the trees best of all. An
avenue curved nobly to the gate, which gave on the
highroad, and to the right of this, fronting the house,
was a delightful garden, laid out in the Dutch fashion.
There were yew trees cut into quaint shapes, stiff and
formal hedges running in straight lines, and beds of
old-fashioned flowers. A fountain, a summer house,
and a statue or two completed the furniture of this
pleasant ground, to which Tait introduced his friend
with unconcealed pride.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I paid for this,&quot; he said, looking round as they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>[pg&nbsp;169]</span>
paced the broad walks. &quot;By itself the house is a
monstrosity, only rendered endurable by its years;
but you must confess that the garden is worth the
money.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is certainly quaint,&quot; replied Larcher, looking
around with an absent air, &quot;but I do not care for
nature in buckram. The formality of this place
offends my eye.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, my dear fellow, you have been used to the
wildness of New Zealand woods of late. You will find
these grounds grow on you. I shall leave you alone
this afternoon to make the attempt.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Indeed,&quot; said Larcher, in some surprise at this
cavalier treatment, &quot;and what do you intend to do?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am going to church.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To church&mdash;on a week-day?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I am not bent on devotion, Claude. But Miss
Paynton is the organist of the parish. To-day is
Wednesday, when she is accustomed to practice
between three and five. I propose to see her there.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can&#39;t you guess? To forestall her with Hilliston.
That gentleman is at Eastbourne, and will probably
come over to-day or to-morrow to ask Jenny to hold
her tongue. As we can&#39;t afford to run such a risk, I
must get all I can out of her to-day.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can I come also?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No!&quot; replied Tait promptly. &quot;It would be necessary
for me to introduce you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What of that? Does it matter?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It matters a great deal. Miss Paynton has, we
believe, obtained the plot of Linton&#39;s novel from a
report of the trial. She will know the name of Larcher,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>[pg&nbsp;170]</span>
and when she hears that you are called so, she will
probably take fright and hold her tongue.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But why should she think I have anything to do
with the case?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your own name. Your guardian&#39;s,&quot; answered
Tait quietly. &quot;Both are mentioned in the report
of the trial. Oh, I assure you, Jenny is a clever
girl, and knows that two and two make four. She
will put this and that together, with the result that
nothing will be gained by the interview.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, well, go alone,&quot; said Claude crossly;
&quot;though I envy you the chance. She is a pretty
girl, from the glimpse I caught of her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And as wise as she is pretty,&quot; laughed Tait. &quot;I
will need all my wits to deal with her. Now, is it
settled?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. You go to your organist, and I&#39;ll potter
about these green alleys and think myself an abbe
of Louis XIV.&#39;s time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Having come to this amicable understanding, they
went in to luncheon, after which Tait gave Claude a
sketch of the people in the neighborhood. Later on
he sent him into the Dutch garden with a cigar and a
book, then betook himself by a short cut through the
park to the Church of St. Elfrida. Shortly after four
he entered by the main door, and found himself in the
aisle listening to the rolling notes of the organ.</p>

<p class="indent">There was no attempt at decoration in that church,
for the vicar was broad in his views, and hating all
ritualism from his soul, took a pride in keeping the
edifice bare and unadorned. The heavy arches of
gray stone, the white-washed walls, with here and
there a mural tablet, the plain communion table
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>[pg&nbsp;171]</span>
under the single stained-glass window; nothing could
be less attractive. Only the deep hues of roof and
pews, the golden pipes of the organ, and the noble
lectern, with its brazen eagle, preserved the church
from looking absolutely irreverent. Through the
glazed windows of plain glass poured in the white
light of day, so that the interior lacked the reverent
gloom, most fitted to the building, and the marks of
time were shown up in what might be termed a cruel
manner. Of old, St. Elfrida&#39;s had been rich in
precious marbles, in splendid altars, and gorgeous
windows, many-hued and elaborate; but the Puritans
had destroyed all these, and reduced the place to its
present bareness, which the vicar took a pride in preserving.
It seemed a shame that so noble a monument
of Norman architecture should be so neglected.</p>

<p class="indent">The red curtains of the organ loft hid the player, but
Tait knew that it was Jenny by the touch, and sat
down in a pew to wait till she had finished her practising.
One piece followed the other, and the stately
music vibrated among the arches in great bursts of
sound, a march, an anthem, an offertory, till Tait
almost fell asleep, lulled by the drone of the pipes.
At length Jenny brought her performance to an end,
and having dismissed the boy who attended to the
bellows, tripped down the aisle with a music book under
her arm. She looked as fresh and pink as a rose,
but quite out of place in that bare, bleak building.
Toward her Tait advanced with a bow.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Here I am, you see, Miss Paynton,&quot; he said, shaking
her by the hand. &quot;I heard your music, and could
not help coming in to listen. I hope you do not mind
my intrusion.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a>[pg&nbsp;172]</span>
&quot;Oh, the Lord of the Manor can go anywhere,&quot; said
Jenny demurely. &quot;I am glad to see you again, Mr.
Tait. The second time to-day, is it not?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; I drove past you in the market place, if I
remember rightly. Won&#39;t you sit down, Miss Paynton,
and give me all the news. I am terribly ignorant of
local gossip, I assure you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Nothing loath, the girl seated herself in a pew near
the door, and occupied herself in fixing her glove.
Remembering the conversation with Linton, she was
slightly uneasy at Tait&#39;s very direct request, but thinking
that it could not possibly have anything to do with
the plot of Linton&#39;s novel, resigned herself to circumstances.
Before the conversation ended she wished
that she had refused to speak to Tait at that moment;
but it was then too late.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;News,&quot; she repeated with a laugh, &quot;do we ever
have any news in this dreary place. I should rather
ask you for news, Mr. Tait, who are fresh from
London.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, but no doubt our young author has already
told you all that is worth hearing,&quot; said Tait, deftly
leading up to his point; &quot;he has been quite the lion
of the season.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. He has been very fortunate,&quot; replied Jenny
carefully. She did not relish the sudden introduction
of this forbidden subject.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And he owes it to you, I believe.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To me. Good gracious, Mr. Tait! what have I to
do with Frank&#39;s success?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;According to what he says, everything.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you mean,&quot; she said, sitting up very
straight, with a deeper color than usual on her cheek.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>[pg&nbsp;173]</span>
&quot;Why,&quot; said Tait, looking directly at her, and
thereby adding to her confusion, &quot;Frank told me that
you supplied the plot of &#39;A Whim of Fate.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what if I did, Mr. Tait?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, nothing, only I must compliment you on your&mdash;shall
we say selection or invention?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The former,&quot; replied Jenny, with extraordinary
quickness. &quot;Since Frank makes no secret of it, why
should I? The plot was told him by me, and I found
it set forth as a trial in a newspaper of 1866.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;H&#39;m! In the <i>Canterbury Observer</i>, I believe?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How do you know that is the name of the paper?&quot;
she asked in a nervous tone.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I learned it from the same source that supplied
me with the history of the Larcher affair.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What! You also know the name of the case?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As you see.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Frank does not know it. I did not show him the
papers. I suppressed all names when I told the story,&quot;
she said incoherently; &quot;but now you&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know all. Yes, you are right,&quot; observed Tait
complacently. &quot;I am better acquainted with the plot
of &#39;A Whim of Fate&#39; than John Parver himself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jenny sat looking at him in a kind of wild amazement.
From the significance of his tone, the extent
of his knowledge, she vaguely felt that something was
wrong. Again, the anger of Kerry, the conversation
of Linton, came into her mind, and she saw into what
difficulty the chance telling of that ancient crime had
led her. Tait noticed that she was perplexed and
frightened, so dexterously strove to set her more at
ease by making a clean breast of it, and enlisting her
sympathy for Claude.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>[pg&nbsp;174]</span>
&quot;You saw the friend who was with me in the cart,
Miss Paynton?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. Who is he?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Claude Larcher!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Claude La&mdash;&mdash; What do you mean, Mr. Tait? I
am in the dark. I do not understand. Have I done
anything wrong in&mdash;in&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In telling the case to Linton?&quot; finished Tait
smoothly. &quot;By no means. As a matter of fact you
have done my friend a service.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is called Larcher! Who is he?&quot; she asked
again with an effort.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is the son of George Larcher, who was
murdered at Horriston in 1866.&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="chXXIII" id="chXXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>

<p class="h3">FACT AND FICTION.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">A silence</span> ensued between them; Tait waiting to
mark the effect of his revelation, while Jenny tried to
grasp the idea that fiction had changed unexpectedly
to fact. To her the case had been more or less of a
romance, far removed and impossible; as such she
had told it to Linton; but now, brought face to face
with the fact that the murdered man&#39;s son was in the
neighborhood, she scarcely knew what to think, certainly
she was ignorant what to say. The shock would
have unstrung a more nervous woman, but Jenny Paynton
was not wanting in pluck, and so braced herself up
to do what was required of her. Yet it took her a little
time to recover, and seeing this, Tait afforded her the
opportunity by talking broadly of the matter; later on
he intended to enter into details.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do not wonder you are startled, Miss Paynton,&quot;
he said easily; &quot;this is a coincidence such as we rarely
meet with in real life. My friend was ignorant of his
father&#39;s fate, but one evening papers were put into his
hands which recounted the tragedy; papers similar to
those whence you obtained the story. He came to
tell me all, but scarcely had he begun his relation,
when I became aware that I knew everything beforehand.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Had you also seen the papers, Mr. Tait?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>[pg&nbsp;176]</span>
&quot;No; but I had read &#39;A Whim of Fate.&#39; There I
found the Larcher affair set forth in the guise of fiction.
Astonished at this I sought out Linton, who, I
learned, was the author hidden under the name of John
Parver, and asked him whence he obtained his material.
He mentioned your name, and so I have come to
you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can you ask? To find out all you know of the
matter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For what reason?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think you can guess my reason,&quot; replied Tait
quietly. &quot;My friend Claude Larcher wishes to find
out who killed his father.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;After five-and-twenty years? Impossible!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So I said at first. Now I am of a different opinion.
In a short space of time we have found out a great
deal. With your help we will discover more, and so
in the end the matter may be cleared up.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You want my help?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Decidedly! It is solely for that reason that
Larcher and I have come here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was a pale-faced Jenny who sat considering a
reply to this remark. She began to be aware that she
had inadvertently set a ball rolling, the progress of
which she was powerless to stop. That chance discovery
in the garret had resuscitated an old scandal,
and brought her into contact with people of whose
existence she had hitherto been ignorant. As a matter
of fact Jenny was responsible for the revival of the
Larcher affair. Her narration of the plot had caused
the writing of the novel, and that in its turn had
freshened the memory of Mrs. Bezel, with the result
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>[pg&nbsp;177]</span>
that Claude had been told the truth. Now he had
come to the source to learn more.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t see how I can help,&quot; said Jenny, fencing
with the inevitable. &quot;If, as you say, Mr. Larcher saw
the <i>Canterbury Observer</i>, he must know as much as
I do about the matter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very true,&quot; replied Tait promptly; &quot;but there
are many things in the novel which are not mentioned
in the report of the case.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Those things are fictitious. You must go to
Frank for information about them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Was that scarfpin episode fictitious?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; replied Jenny, with some hesitation.
&quot;Kerry told me that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Kerry!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Our man-servant. He has been with my father
ever since I can remember, and is quite the autocrat
of the household. He found me with those papers
one day after I told Frank the story, and took them
away from me. You have no idea how angry he was
that I had read them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yet he told you about the scarfpin?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh! that was because I asked him who had committed
the crime,&quot; said Jenny quickly. &quot;At first he
would not talk about it, but when I said that no doubt
Jeringham was guilty, since he had fled, Kerry denied
it, and asserted that the crime was committed by the
man who owned the garnet scarfpin.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did he say who owned it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No. He went away before I could ask him,
and will not let me speak of the matter. In the
book Frank makes Michael Dene the owner of the
pin.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>[pg&nbsp;178]</span>
&quot;Ah! and Michael Dene is Francis Hilliston in real
life.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How do you know that?&quot; asked the girl quickly,
with a nervous start.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear young lady, I have read the report of the
case and the novel. It is easy to see who your
fictitious personages are. Do you know Mr. Hilliston?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A little. He has visited my father once or twice,
but we have not seen him now for many years. In
fact, I had almost forgotten his name till I saw it in
the case.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Humph! In the novel Michael Dene, the man
meant for Hilliston, commits the crime. Was that
your idea or Linton&#39;s?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was Frank&#39;s. Dene was the least likely person
to be suspected, and it was necessary to keep up the
mystery to the end. But I think he ought to have
made Markham commit the crime.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Markham is Jeringham, is he not?&quot; said Tait
thoughtfully. &quot;With your permission, Miss Paynton,
we will use the real names, not the fictitious. It will
help us to understand the matter more clearly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jenny stood up, and tucked the music book under
her arm. The recollection of Kerry&#39;s anger made her
feel that she was unwise to talk so freely to a stranger
about the matter. Hitherto, Tait had taken his own
way; now she was resolved to take hers.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t want to speak any more about it,&quot; she
said resolutely. &quot;I am very sorry I told Frank the
story, and meddled with those papers. Let me pass,
Mr. Tait, and drop the subject.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, don&#39;t do that,&quot; cried Tait, rising in his turn,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>[pg&nbsp;179]</span>
and barring her way. &quot;You must not fail me at the
eleventh hour. My friend is bent on learning the
truth, and surely you will not grudge him help.
Remember it is the murderer of his father whom he
desires to bring to justice.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can&#39;t say any more. I know no more, Mr. Tait.
Do you know what I am about to do?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; said Tait, looking at her grave face in some
wonder.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am going home to tell my father and Kerry what
use I made of those papers. If I have acted wrongly,
it is but right that they should know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They will know shortly without your telling, Miss
Jenny.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, you intend to speak of the matter yourself?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps! But in this case I allude to Hilliston.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hilliston!&quot; repeated Jenny, in surprise. &quot;What
has he to do with the matter?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A great deal, I fancy. More than you or I suspect.
He is now at Eastbourne, and I am certain he
will come over here to see you to-morrow.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To see me! Why?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because he wants you to hold your tongue about
these matters.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Tait,&quot; she cried, with a sudden flush, &quot;surely
you are not biased by Frank&#39;s book? You imply that
Mr. Hilliston is afraid of the truth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think he is! In fact I am sure he is.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you believe he committed that cowardly crime
of twenty-five years ago?&quot; asked Jenny, with scorn.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is your own opinion?&quot; was the counter
question.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I believe that Jeringham was the murderer.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>[pg&nbsp;180]</span>
Yes! Captain Larcher went in disguise to that ball,
and learned the truth from the lips of his own wife. I
believe she loved Jeringham. I believe he followed
her home on that fatal night, urging her to fly. Then
Captain Larcher appeared on the scene, and in the
struggle that ensued he was killed. Jeringham fled,
and Mrs. Larcher died. That, I am certain, is the true
history of this crime.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You, then, think that Mrs. Larcher was privy to
the murder?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I don&#39;t say that!&quot; said the girl, shrinking
back; &quot;it is impossible to say. But I have no right
to talk to you about these matters, Mr. Tait. I have
told you all I know. Let me pass, please.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tait bowed, and stood aside hat in hand. She flitted
down the aisle, a slim girlish figure, and had arrived at
the door when his voice arrested her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;One moment, Miss Paynton,&quot; he said, following
her quickly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t tell your father of this for twenty-four
hours.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because I want to prove to you that what I say is
true. Hilliston will inform your father himself, and
ask you to be silent.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is too late for that now&mdash;unfortunately.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why unfortunately? You should be glad to have
strengthened the hands of justice. However, we need
not speak of that now. Will you promise to withhold
your confession for the time I ask?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I promise nothing, Mr. Tait. Good-evening!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But, Miss Paynton,&quot; he said, following her again,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>[pg&nbsp;181]</span>
&quot;you surely will not be so rash. You can have no
idea how important these matters are to my friend.
Mr. Hilliston is certain to inform your father within
the next twenty-four hours, so surely you can give us
that time to do what we can. I beg of you&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jenny stopped irresolutely, and looked at Tait with
a mixture of anger and doubt. The matter had now
grown so intricate that she did not know what to do,
what to say. She had not known Tait long enough to
be guided by his advice, or to rely on his judgment;
and her impulse was to tell her father and receive suggestions
as to what was best to be done under the
circumstances. Yet, she also mistrusted Hilliston, as
his connection with the Horriston case seemed to her
to be by no means as simple as had appeared at first
sight. She was suspicious of him, and if he came over
to Thurston especially to ask her to be silent, that
would go a long way toward confirming her doubts.
And then, after all, no harm could be done within
the twenty-four hours, as afterward she could tell her
father; thus, at once satisfying her conscience and her
curiosity, she made the compromise.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well, Mr. Tait,&quot; she said gravely. &quot;I
promise to be silent for twenty-four hours.&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>[pg&nbsp;182]</span></p>

<h2><a name="chXXIV" id="chXXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>

<p class="h3">A NEW SUSPICION.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Spenser Tait</span> walked back to the Manor House with
the pleasing conviction that he had passed a very profitable
hour. He had warned Jenny about the probable
movements of Hilliston, and thus had put her on her
guard against that astute individual. Once an idea
enters a woman&#39;s head, it is impossible to get it out
again, and Tait, by half hinting a confirmation of
Jenny&#39;s suspicions regarding the lawyer, had made her
uneasily conscious that Hilliston was a man to be
watched and reckoned with. If Hilliston fulfilled
Tait&#39;s prophecy, the little man believed that Jenny
would resent his interference, penetrate his motives,
and thwart him, if possible. In spite of her denial
that she thought him guilty, Tait could not but perceive
that the reading of the case had not biased her
in favor of the dead man&#39;s friend. Jenny believed that
Jeringham had committed the crime, but, if Hilliston
acted indiscreetly, it would not take much to induce
her to alter that opinion. Tait chuckled as he thought
of these things; for he had not only cut the ground
from under Hilliston&#39;s feet by warning Jenny of his
possible arrival, but had, as he truly thought, converted
a passive spectator into an active enemy.</p>

<p class="indent">Again, he had learned that it was the old servant
who had informed the girl concerning the scarfpin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>[pg&nbsp;183]</span>
episode. Kerry said that the man who owned the
scarfpin was guilty; and Kerry knew to whom the
scarfpin belonged. If he could only be induced to
part with the information there might be some chance
of solving the mystery; but Kerry&#39;s&mdash;or rather Denis
Bantry&#39;s&mdash;past conduct and present attitude were so
doubtful that it was difficult to know how he would act,
even though he were driven into a corner. Tait had
little doubt in his own mind that Kerry was the old
servant of Captain Larcher, for no one but he knew
the truth about the scarfpin. Nevertheless, he failed
to understand why the man had changed his name, and
why he was staying at Thorston as servant to a recluse
like Paynton. Only a personal interview with him
could settle these vexed questions, but Tait was of two
opinions whether Kerry would be amenable to reason,
and confess his reasons for such concealment.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus thinking, and trying to come to some conclusion
regarding the new aspect placed upon affairs by
the conversation with Jenny, the little man arrived
home, and learning that Claude was still in the garden,
he went there to report the result of his interview, and
discuss the situation. Larcher was leaning back in a
comfortable garden chair, with an open book on his
knee, but, instead of reading, he was staring with unseeing
eyes into the fresh green of the tree above him.
On hearing Tait&#39;s brisk step he hastily lowered his
head with a flush, as though he had been caught doing
something wrong, and grew still more confused when
he saw his friend looking at him with a queer expression
of amusement.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She is a pretty girl,&quot; said Tait significantly; &quot;and
I don&#39;t wonder you are thinking of her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>[pg&nbsp;184]</span>
&quot;Thinking of who?&quot; asked Claude merrily, at this
reading of his thoughts. &quot;Are you a mind reader?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So far as you are concerned, I am. Knowing how
easily influenced you are by the sight of a pretty face,
I don&#39;t think I am far wrong in guessing that your
thoughts were with Jenny Paynton.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, yes,&quot; replied Claude, with a frank laugh.
&quot;I do not deny it. The glimpse I caught of her as we
drove past in the cart charmed me greatly. I have
rarely seen a more sympathetic and piquant face.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bah! You say that of every woman you meet.
Your geese are always swans.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jenny is, at all events!&quot; said Larcher promptly;
&quot;and you cannot deny that; but I admire her exceedingly&mdash;that
is, as a pretty woman. You see, I already
call her Jenny in my own mind, but that is because you
always talk of her by her Christian name. Now,
Jenny is&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear Don Juan,&quot; said Tait blandly; &quot;don&#39;t
you think we had better leave off these erotics and get
to business. You must not indulge in the ideal to the
exclusion of the real.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, not that business!&quot; sighed Larcher wearily.
&quot;I don&#39;t believe we&#39;ll do any good with it. The mystery
of my father&#39;s death is likely to remain one to the
end of time for all I can see. Every trace is obliterated
by the snows of twenty-five years.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not entirely, my friend. For instance, I have
learned an important fact to-day.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;From Miss Paynton?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. We had a long conversation, and she was
considerably startled when she learned the object of
your visit here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>[pg&nbsp;185]</span>
&quot;Was it wise of you to tell her?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, yes,&quot; returned Tait decidedly. &quot;We can do
nothing without her help, and that she will refuse to
give us unless she learns the reason of our inquiries.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is her opinion of the matter? The same as
Linton&#39;s, I suppose?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;By no means. She thinks that Jeringham killed
your father; but I am not altogether sure that she
does not suspect Hilliston. After all, she may come
round to Linton&#39;s opinion before long.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did you tell her that we suspected Hilliston?&quot;
asked Claude anxiously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not directly. But I permitted myself to hint as
much. However, I only aided the seed of suspicion
to sprout, for it was already implanted in her mind.
You look astonished, Claude, but recall to your recollection
the report of that case, and you will see that
Hilliston was far too much mixed up in the matter to
be as ignorant as he pretended to be at the trial.
According to his evidence he had not left the ballroom,
and consequently could have known nothing of
the tragedy which was then being enacted at The
Laurels. Yet, he knows details which, so far as I can
see, prove him to have been an eye-witness.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Claude jumped to his feet, and began restlessly pacing
up and down the gravel walk. He yet retained
some belief in Hilliston, and was reluctant to think
that one to whom he owed so much should be guilty
of so foul a crime. It was true that certain circumstances
looked black against him, but these were
purely theoretical, and by no means founded on absolute
facts. After due consideration Claude inclined to
the belief that Tait was too easily satisfied of Hilliston&#39;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>[pg&nbsp;186]</span>
guilt, and was willing to accept any stray facts
likely to confirm his theory. Thus biased he could
not possibly look on the matter in a fair and equable
manner. The wish was altogether too greatly father
to the thought.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t think you give Hilliston a fair show, Tait,&quot;
he said, stepping before his friend. &quot;If he winks an
eye you look on it as a sign of his guilt. My mother
assured me solemnly that Hilliston was at the ball
when the tragedy occurred.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, in that case, I have nothing more to say,&quot;
said Tait coldly. &quot;Still,&quot; he added rather spitefully,
&quot;I should like to know why Mr. Hilliston is so anxious
to keep the matter quiet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tait!&quot; said Claude hoarsely, sitting down by his
friend and seizing his arm; &quot;do you know I have often
asked myself that question, and I have found a reply
thereto; the only reply of which I can think.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He paused, and looked fearfully around; then wiped
the sweat off his white face with a nervous gesture.
Tait eyed him in amazement, and could not understand
what had come over his usually self-possessed friend;
but he had no time to speak, for Claude, with an irrepressible
shiver, whispered in a low voice:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What if my mother should be guilty, after all? Ah,
you may well look astonished, but that is the hideous
doubt which has haunted me for days. My mother
says she ran at my father with a dagger, but fainted
before she struck him. What if she did not faint; if
she really killed him, and Hilliston, knowing this, is
trying to screen her, and trying to save me from knowing
the truth?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But, my dear fellow, the trial&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>[pg&nbsp;187]</span>
&quot;Never mind the trial. We now know that Denis
swore falsely when he asserted that my father was not
in the house on that night. We know that he was in
the house, and that my mother found him with Mona
Bantry. Her jealousy might have carried her to
greater lengths than she intended to go. Denis saved
her at the trial by telling a lie; but we know the truth,
and I cannot rid myself of a doubt, that she may be
guilty. If so, in place of being an enemy, Hilliston is
acting the part of a friend in placing obstacles in our
way.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tait shook his head. &quot;I do not believe Mrs. Bezel
is guilty,&quot; he said quietly; &quot;if she had been, she
would certainly not have written to you, and thus
forced Hilliston to show you the papers. Banish the
thought from your heart, Claude. I am as certain as
I sit here that your mother is innocent of the crime.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If I could only be certain!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And why should you not be,&quot; exclaimed Tait
vigorously. &quot;An eye-witness could tell you the
truth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where can I find an eye-witness?&quot; cried Claude,
with an impatient frown. &quot;Mona Bantry and Jeringham
have both fled; they are probably dead by this
time. My mother denies that she struck the blow,
and Hilliston, she says, was at the ball when the
murder took place. Who can tell me the truth?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Denis Bantry,&quot; said Tait quietly. &quot;Listen to me,
Claude. The episode of the garnet scarfpin, which to
my mind is the clew to the assassin, is only known to
your mother, to Hilliston, and to Denis Bantry. Now
Hilliston denies that such a trinket exists; your
mother insists that it was found on the bank of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>[pg&nbsp;188]</span>
river after the murder. The only person who can give
the casting vote&mdash;who can arbitrate, so to speak&mdash;is
Denis Bantry.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And where is Denis Bantry? Lost or dead, years
ago.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing of the sort, my friend. Denis Bantry is
alive and in this neighborhood. Yes; Jenny Paynton
admitted to me that the scarfpin episode was related
to her by their old servant, Kerry. Therefore, it
naturally follows that Kerry is Denis Bantry.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But why is he hiding here under another name?&quot;
said Larcher, after he had digested this piece of information,
with a due display of astonishment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That I cannot say. Unless,&quot; here Tait hesitated
before uttering his opinion, &quot;unless Denis Bantry is
the guilty person.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But that is impossible; that is out of the question,&quot;
said Claude decidedly. &quot;He was devoted to my
father, as you know. Why should he turn and kill him
without a cause?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah!&quot; said Tait significantly; &quot;what if he had a
cause, and a very good one, to kill your father. Recall
your mother&#39;s confession. She returned at three
o&#39;clock in the morning and found her husband alone
with Mona, the sister of Denis. She accused Mona of
being her husband&#39;s mistress, and the girl confessed
her guilt, which your father evidently could not deny.
Now what is more probable than that Denis, attracted
by the high voices, should have followed your mother
to the room. There he would hear the truth, probably
while waiting at the door. What follows? With his
impulsive Irish temperament he dashes in, hot to avenge
the wrong done to his sister. The dagger dropped by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189"></a>[pg&nbsp;189]</span>
your mother is at his feet; he picks it up and kills his
master on the instant. Your mother, in a faint on the
floor, knows nothing of what is going on, and brother
and sister remove the body to the river, where they
drop it in. Then Mona is sent away by Denis to hide
her shame and evade awkward questions, while he
remains.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But why should he remain?&quot; interrupted Claude
smartly. &quot;Would it not have been wiser for him
to fly?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And so confess his guilt. No! He induces Jeringham
to fly, with a threat of denouncing him as the
murderer of Larcher. Jeringham is in such a dilemma
that, seeing that all the evidence will be against him, he
takes to flight. Thereupon Denis is able to save his
mistress, and himself, by denying that Larcher came to
the house on that night. Of course, this is all pure
theory; still it is as circumstantial as the rest of the
evidence we have in hand.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Claude was by no means inclined to agree with
this last remark. &quot;There are flaws in your argument,&quot;
he said, after a few moments&#39; reflection. &quot;If
Denis intended to deny that my father was in the house
on that night, why should he induce Jeringham to fly?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To make assurance doubly sure. No doubt he
intended first to put the blame on Jeringham, but finding
that Mrs. Larcher was likely to be accused, he made
things safe for her by denying that his master returned
on that evening. Only four people knew of the return;
Mona, who fled, Mrs. Larcher, who held her tongue to
save her neck; Denis, who swore falsely to serve his
mistress; and Jeringham, who thought he might be
accused of the crime.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>[pg&nbsp;190]</span>
&quot;But why wouldn&#39;t he have denounced Denis?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He was doubtless ignorant that Denis was the
criminal. You forget that Jeringham was in the
garden, and knew nothing of what was taking place
in the sitting room. Denis rushed out, and finding
Jeringham may have told him that Mrs. Larcher had
killed her husband on his account. The man, bewildered
and shocked, yet sees that he is complicated
in the case through his love for Mrs. Larcher; he
guesses that owing to the gossip of the place he may
be accused of the crime, and so does the wisest thing
he could do,&mdash;the only thing he could do,&mdash;and seeks
refuge in flight.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then you think Denis is guilty?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can&#39;t say. As you see, I can make a strong case
out against your mother, against Jeringham, against
Denis. Yes, I could even make a case against Mona
Bantry; but it is sole theory. Yet Denis must have
some reason for hiding here under the name of
&#39;Kerry,&#39; and for keeping those papers found by Jenny
which contained a report of the case. The case is
strong against Hilliston, I admit, but is stronger
against your father&#39;s own servant.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t think so,&quot; said Claude quietly. &quot;If Denis
had killed my father, he would not have told Jenny
about the scarfpin.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why not! The scarfpin may have belonged to
Jeringham&mdash;to Hilliston. For his own safety&mdash;now
that the case is recognized after so many years by a
girl&#39;s rash action&mdash;Denis would not hesitate to blame
them to save himself. Taking it all round,&quot; added
Tait, with the air of one who has settled the question,
&quot;I think the conduct of Denis is very suspicious, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>[pg&nbsp;191]</span>
I would not be surprised if he turned out to be the
guilty person.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But the acts of Hilliston?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tait rubbed his head and looked vexed, for he was
unable to give a direct answer. &quot;Let us leave the
matter alone for the present,&quot; he said crossly. &quot;I
am getting bewildered with all this talk. Only one
person can tell the truth, and that is Kerry, alias
Denis Bantry.&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="chXXV" id="chXXV"></a>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>

<p class="h3">THE RECLUSE.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Meanwhile</span> Jenny was proceeding homeward in
a rather unhappy state of mind. The conversation
had left an unpleasant impression, and she was by no
means sure what it would lead to. A hundred times
did she wish that she had not meddled with the
matter; but it was now too late for regrets, and she
recognized that she must bear the burden of her
wrong-doing. Though, indeed, she could see no
reason to characterize her action by so harsh a name.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A bundle of old papers in a garret,&quot; she thought,
walking quickly through the lane; &quot;where was the
harm in reading them? And, as they contained an
interesting story, I fail to see where I acted wrongly
in telling it to Frank. The Larcher affair can have
nothing to do with papa, even though Kerry was so
angry. I&#39;ll speak to Kerry, and ask him if I have
done wrong.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">According to her promise she was determined to
say nothing to her father for at least twenty-four
hours, for she was curious to see if Mr. Hilliston
would call to speak of the matter. If he did so, then
would be the time to exculpate herself; but, pending
such visit, she saw no reason why she should not consult
with Kerry. He had expressed anger at her possession
of the papers, so he, if anyone, would be able
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>[pg&nbsp;193]</span>
to explain if she had been rash. On Kerry&#39;s answer
would depend the explanation due to her father.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus thinking, she speedily arrived in a deep lane,
at the end of which she turned into a white gate set in
a rugged stone wall. Nut trees bent over this wall,
dropping their fruit into the ruts of the road, and on
the opposite side rose a steep green bank topped by
blackberry bushes. This byway was little frequented,
and here quiet constantly reigned, unbroken save by
the voices of birds. It was a great place for nightingales,
and many a summer evening did Jenny stand
under the bending boughs listening to the warblings
of those night singers. So bird-haunted was the spot
that here, if anywhere, Keats might have composed
his famous ode. Indeed, the road was known as
Nightingale Lane, for obvious reasons.</p>

<p class="indent">Passing through the gate, Jenny saw before her the
little garden, odorous with homely cottage flowers&mdash;sweet-williams,
delicate pea blossom, ruddy marigolds,
and somber bushes of rosemary. A hawthorn hedge
on the right divided the flowers from the kitchen
garden; while to the left grew gnarled apple and pear
trees, now white with bloom. A sprawling peach tree
clung to the guarding wall of the lane, and beds of
thyme and mignonette perfumed the still air. In the
center of this sweetness was built the humble cottage
of Ferdinand Paynton, a broad, low-roofed building,
with whitewashed walls and quaint windows, diamond-paned
and snowy curtained. Pots of flowers were set
within, and under the eaves of the thatched roof
twittered the darting swallows. One often sees such
peaceful homesteads in the heart of England, breathing
quiet and tranquillity. Rose Cottage, as it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>[pg&nbsp;194]</span>
called, from the prevailing flower in the garden, was
worthy to be enshrined in a fairy tale.</p>

<p class="indent">Here lived Ferdinand Paynton, with his only
daughter, and two servants, male and female. The
one was Kerry, a crabbed old Irishman, stanch as
steel, and devoted to his master; the other a withered
crone who was never seen without her bonnet, yet who
bore the reputation of being an excellent cook, and an
economical housekeeper. As Mr. Paynton was poor,
and spent more than he could afford on books, Maria
was very necessary to him, as she scraped and screwed
with miserly care, yet withal gave him good meals, and
kept the tiny house like a new pin. Kerry attended
principally to the garden and the books; looked after
Jenny, whom he was always scolding, and passed his
leisure time in fishing in the Lax.</p>

<p class="indent">Hot or cold, wet or fine, summer or winter, nothing
varied in the routine of Rose Cottage. Mr. Paynton
rose at nine, took his breakfast, and read his paper till
ten, then walked for an hour or so in the garden with
Jenny. Till luncheon he wrote; after luncheon he
slept, and then wrote again till dinner time. The
evening in summer was spent in the garden, in winter
within doors, before a roaring fire in the bookroom.
For more than twenty years life had gone on in this
peaceful fashion, and during that time Jenny could
not remember the occurrence of a single episode
worth recording. Rose Cottage might have been the
palace of the Sleeping Beauty during the hundred
years&#39; spell.</p>

<p class="indent">The inhabitant of this hermitage was a puzzle to the
gossips of Thorston, for, after the industrious inquiries
of twenty years, they were as wise as ever touching his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>[pg&nbsp;195]</span>
antecedents. Then he had arrived with Kerry, and
his daughter, a child of five, and, staying at the Inn of
St. Elfrida, had looked about for a small place in the
neighborhood. Rose Cottage, then empty and much
neglected, appeared to be the most secluded spot procurable,
so Mr. Paynton set it in order, patched the
roof, cultivated the garden, and took up his abode
therein. Here he had lived ever since, rarely leaving
it, seeing few people, and accepting no invitations.
The man was a recluse, and disliked his fellow-creatures,
so when Thorston became aware of his peculiarities
he was left alone to live as he chose. It may be
guessed that his peculiar habits made him unpopular.</p>

<p class="indent">The vicar was friendly to the misanthrope, for in
Paynton he found a kindred soul in the matter of
books; and many a pleasant evening did they spend in
discussing literary subjects. The bookroom was the
pleasantest apartment in the house, cosy and warm,
and lined throughout with volumes. In the deep window
stood the desk, and here Ferdinand Paynton sat
and wrote all day, save when he took his usual stroll
in the garden. Jenny had also grown up in the bookroom,
and, as her education had been conducted by her
father, she was remarkably intelligent for a country
maiden, and could talk excellently on literature, old
and new. For the softer graces of womanhood she
was indebted to the care of Mrs. Linton, who from the
first had taken a great interest in the motherless girl.</p>

<p class="indent">Into this room came Jenny, with her mind full of the
recent conversation with Tait. She threw down her
music-book on the table and went to kiss her father.
He was seated in his armchair, instead of at his desk
as usual, and looked rather sternly at her as she bent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>[pg&nbsp;196]</span>
over him. Tall and white-haired, with a sad face and
a slim figure, the old man looked singularly interesting,
his appearance being enhanced by his peculiar
garb, a dressing gown and a black skullcap. Indeed,
he was more like a mediæval magician than an aged
gentleman of the nineteenth century. He looked like
a man with a history, which was doubtless the reason
Thorston gossips were so anxious concerning his past.
In country towns curiosity is quite a disease.</p>

<p class="indent">In the hurry of her entrance Jenny had not noticed
that a stranger was present, but on greeting her father
with a fond kiss, she turned to see an elderly gentleman
looking at her intently. Mr. Paynton explained
the presence of the stranger with less than his usual
suavity, but from the tone of his voice Jenny guessed
that he was angry with her. As it afterward appeared
he had good reason to be.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jenny, this is my friend, Mr. Hilliston.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hilliston! Jenny could not suppress a start of surprise,
even of alarm. The prophecy of Tait had been
fulfilled sooner than she had expected. There was
something uncanny in the speedy accomplishment of a
prognostication in which, at the time, she had hardly
believed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hilliston! Mr. Hilliston!&quot; she repeated, with a
gasp of surprise, &quot;already!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This time it was Hilliston&#39;s turn to be surprised,
and his face darkened with suspicion.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What am I to understand by &#39;already,&#39; Miss
Paynton?&quot; he said quickly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why! That is&mdash;Mr. Tait&mdash;&mdash;&quot; began Jenny, in
excuse, when her father cut her short. He rose from
his chair, and exclaimed in a voice of alarm:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>[pg&nbsp;197]</span>
&quot;Tait! Then you have seen him already?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, father,&quot; said the girl, in some bewilderment
at his tone.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In the church, half an hour ago.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did he question you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He did.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you replied?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I answered his questions,&quot; said Jenny quietly, &quot;if
you refer to the Larcher affair.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do refer to it,&quot; groaned her father, sinking back
into his chair. &quot;Unhappy girl! you know not what
trouble you have caused.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hilliston said nothing, but stood moodily considering
what was best to be done. He saw that Tait had
been too clever for him, and had anticipated his
arrival. Yet he had come as speedily as possible; not
a moment had he lost since his arrival in Eastbourne
to seek out Jenny and ask her to be silent. But it was
too late; he had missed his opportunity by a few minutes,
and it only remained for him to learn how much
the girl had told his enemy. No wonder he hated
Tait; the fellow was too dangerous a foeman to be
despised.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We may yet mend matters,&quot; he said judiciously,
&quot;if Miss Jenny will repeat so much of the conversation
as she remembers.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why should I repeat it?&quot; said Jenny, objecting to
this interference, as Tait guessed she would. &quot;There
was nothing wrong in the conversation with Mr. Tait
that I know of.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There was nothing wrong in your telling Linton
the story you found in <i>The Canterbury Observer</i>,&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>[pg&nbsp;198]</span>
replied Hilliston dryly; &quot;yet it would have been as
well had you not done so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Father,&quot; cried Jenny, turning toward the old man
with an appealing gesture, &quot;have I done wrong?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, child,&quot; he answered, with a sigh, &quot;very
wrong, but you sinned in ignorance. Kerry told me
you had found the bundle and read about the trial, but
I passed that over. Now it is different. You repeated
it to young Linton, and Mr. Hilliston tells me that all
London knows the story through his book.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am very sorry,&quot; said Jenny, after a pause, &quot;but
I really did not know that it was wrong of me to act
as I have done. A bundle of old newspapers in a
garret! Surely I was justified in reading them&mdash;in
telling Frank what I conceived would be a good plot
for a story.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t blame you, Miss Paynton,&quot; said Hilliston
kindly; &quot;but it so happens that your father did not
want that affair again brought before the public. After
all, you have had less to do with it than Fate.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Than Fate,&quot; interrupted Paynton, with a groan.
&quot;Good Heavens, am I to be&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Paynton!&quot; said Hilliston, in a warning voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I forgot,&quot; muttered the old man, with a shiver.
&quot;No more&mdash;no more. Jenny, tell us what you said to
Mr. Tait.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Considerably astonished, the girl repeated the conversation
as closely as she could remember. Both
Hilliston and her father listened with the keenest
interest, and seemed relieved when she finished.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is not so bad as I expected,&quot; said the former,
with a nod. &quot;All you have to do, Paynton, is to
warn Kerry against gratifying the curiosity of these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id="page199"></a>[pg&nbsp;199]</span>
young men. They will be certain to ask him questions.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Kerry will baffle them; have no fear of that,&quot; said
Paynton harshly, &quot;and, Jenny, you are not to refer
to this subject again with Mr. Tait.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Am I not to speak to him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Her father interrogated Hilliston with a look,
received a nod, and answered accordingly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You can speak to Mr. Tait, if you choose, and no
doubt you will be introduced by the vicar to Mr.
Larcher. I place no prohibition on your speaking to
them, but only warn you to avoid the subject of the
Larcher affair. Promise!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I promise. I am sorry I ever had anything to do
with it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Say no more about it, my dear,&quot; said Hilliston,
patting her shoulder. &quot;How could you be expected
to know? But now you have been warned, do not
speak more of it. We do not wish the unjustifiable
curiosity of these idle young men to be gratified.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you assist them to learn that which had better
be hidden, you will ruin me,&quot; cried Paynton, with a
passionate gesture.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Father! Ruin you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes! It means ruin, disgrace&mdash;perhaps death!
Ah!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He broke down with a cry, and Hilliston, taking
Jenny by the hand, led her to the door.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go away, my dear. Your father is ill,&quot; he said, in
a whisper, and pushing her outside the door, locked it
forthwith. Jenny stood in the passage, in an agony
of fear and surprise. Ruin! Disgrace! Death!
What was the meaning of those terrible words?</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200"></a>[pg&nbsp;200]</span></p>

<h2><a name="chXXVI" id="chXXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>

<p class="h3">AN OLD SERVANT.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Leaving</span> the two men to talk over their dark secrets
together, Jenny went into the garden. Her brow
burned as with fever, and her understanding was confused
by the thoughts which filled her mind. What
was the meaning of her father&#39;s words? Why had Mr.
Hilliston come over from Eastbourne to request her
silence? And what was the connection between him
and her sole surviving parent? She paced up and
down the gravel walk vainly asking herself these questions,
and racking her brain as to possible answers.
Hitherto the sky of her young life had been pure and
serene; but now, by her own act&mdash;as though she had
unconsciously wrought a malignant spell&mdash;a sudden
storm had arisen, which threatened to overturn the
foundations of her small world. In the very unexpectedness
of these events lay their terror.</p>

<p class="indent">As Tait shrewdly surmised, Jenny was by no means
satisfied with the evidence of Hilliston at the trial of
Mrs. Larcher. So far as she could judge from the
unsatisfactory report in <i>The Canterbury Observer</i>, he
had given his version of the affair glibly enough;
yet there seemed to be something behind which
he was anxious to suppress. Definitely enough he
stated that he had not been at The Laurels on
the fatal night; that he had not seen Captain Larcher
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>[pg&nbsp;201]</span>
since he left for London; that he had not noted
whether Mrs. Larcher wore that all-important dagger
when she left the ballroom. But, pressed by an evidently
suspicious counsel, he accounted so minutely
for every moment of his time, his evidence had about
it such an air of frank falseness, that even unsophisticated
Jenny saw that the man was acting a part. She
did not believe him guilty of the crime, but she was
certain in her own mind that he knew who had struck
the fatal blow; nay more, Jenny thought it not impossible
that he had been at The Laurels after three
that morning, in spite of his denial, and had seen the
tragedy take place. Tait&#39;s hints, confirming her own
doubts, led her to gravely doubt the purity of Mr.
Hilliston&#39;s motives then and now.</p>

<p class="indent">But what most perplexed the girl was the reason
why the lawyer called to see her father on the subject
and requested her silence. She knew nothing
of the tragedy save through the papers&mdash;those old,
faded papers, dated 1866, which she had found in the
garret. She was not born when the murder took
place, so Hilliston could not possibly wish to close
her mouth for her own sake. It was on her father&#39;s
account that Jenny feared. What could he know of
an obscure crime perpetrated in a country town so
many years ago; she could recall no mention of his
name in the report of the trial; yet his words led her
to suspect that he was more closely connected with
that tragic past than he chose to admit. Could it be
that her father was a relative of Jeringham, and, knowing
that Jeringham was still alive, wished to stop all
inquiries made as to his whereabouts, lest he should
be punished for his early sin? This was the only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>[pg&nbsp;202]</span>
feasible suggestion she could make, and yet it failed
to satisfy her too exacting mind.</p>

<p class="indent">Again, there was Kerry. Kerry certainly had a personal
interest in the case; else he could scarcely have
related the episode of the scarfpin. Moreover, he had
been very angry when he found her with the papers in
her possession; and putting these two things together
it would seem as if he knew more than he chose to tell.
Jenny thought, for the gratification of her own curiosity,
she would ask Kerry to explain these matters;
and so went to the kitchen in search of him. Maria
was there, cross and deaf as usual, and intimated that
Kerry had been out some two hours on a message.
This sounded extraordinary to Jenny, who knew that
the old servant rarely left the house; but it argued that
her father was anxious to have him out of the way during
the visit of Hilliston. What did it all mean? A
horrible fear seized the girl, lest she should have set
some machinery in motion which would end in crushing
her unhappy father. Unhappy he had always been,
and given to seclusion. There must be some reason
for this, and Jenny felt a vague alarm, which she could
neither express nor display. Dearly enough had she
paid for meddling with that old bundle of papers.</p>

<p class="indent">Again she returned to the garden, and went outside
into the lane in order to see if Kerry was in sight. In
a few minutes he came shuffling round the corner, and
his withered face relaxed into a grin when he saw her
standing by the gate. She was the apple of his eye,
and though he scolded her often himself, yet he never
let anyone say a word against her. To look askance
at Jenny was to lose Kerry&#39;s favor and win his enmity
forever.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203"></a>[pg&nbsp;203]</span>
&quot;Ah! there ye are, me darling Miss Jenny,&quot; he said,
with the familiarity of an old servant, &quot;watching and
waiting for poor old Kerry. Sure it is a sunbeam you
are in this dark lane.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Kerry! I want to speak to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The change in her tone struck him at once, and he
peered sharply into her fresh face with his bleared
eyes. A look of wonder stole into them at the sight
of her white cheeks, and he crossed himself before replying
so as to avert any evil that might befall. Kerry
always lived in a state of suspense, waiting for a bolt
from the blue. Jenny&#39;s scared face almost assured him
that it had fallen.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is it, <i>alannah</i>?&quot; he asked, pausing at the
gate. &quot;Is anything wrong?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, no! nothing is wrong, Kerry! What could
be wrong?&quot; said Jenny nervously; &quot;only papa has a
visitor.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Augh! His riverence?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No; not the vicar. A stranger&mdash;or at least
almost a stranger,&quot; she said, half to herself. &quot;It is
many years since Mr. Hilliston came here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Hilliston!&quot; cried Kerry, with an ashen face.
&quot;The black curse on him and his! What is he doing
with the master?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know, Kerry,&quot; replied Jenny, rather astonished
at the old man&#39;s vehemence; &quot;he has been with
father over two hours.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And I was sent away,&quot; muttered Kerry, under his
breath. &quot;Sorrow befall you, black attorney that you
are. Never did you cross a threshold without bringing
grief to all hearts. It was an evil day we saw you, and
an evil day when we see you again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>[pg&nbsp;204]</span>
He uplifted his hands as though about to invoke a
curse on Hilliston, then, unexpectedly letting them fall,
he turned sharply on Jenny.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How did he come, miss?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;By train from Eastbourne&mdash;no doubt he walked
from the station.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll drive him back,&quot; exclaimed Kerry, in quite
an amiable voice. &quot;Sure he&#39;ll be weary on his legs.
Why not? I&#39;ll borrow his riverence&#39;s trap and the
little mare with the white foreleg, but&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Kerry, father might not like it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Get along with ye,&quot; said Kerry cheerfully; &quot;sure
his riverence has offered the trap a hundred times.
I&#39;ll take it on myself to explain to the master. Keep
Mr. Hilliston here till he sees me arriving up this
road&mdash;a dirty one it is, too, bad cess to it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He was hurrying off, when Jenny stopped him. She
saw that his borrowing of the vicar&#39;s honey trap was a
mere excuse to get Hilliston to himself for half an hour,
and, rendered more curious than ever by Kerry&#39;s artful
way of arranging matters, she ran after him and pulled
his sleeve.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Kerry! Kerry! Has Mr. Hilliston come over to
see papa about the Larcher affair?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How should I know,&quot; retorted Kerry, relapsing
into his crusty humor; &quot;for shame, Miss Jenny! Is
it your business or mine?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is mine,&quot; said the girl, with a resolute look on
her face. &quot;Mr. Hilliston came over to ask me to be
silent about what was contained in those papers you
took from me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How does he know of that, miss?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>[pg&nbsp;205]</span>
&quot;Because all London now knows the story of the
Larcher affair.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Augh! Get away with ye. Sure it&#39;s a fool you&#39;re
making of old Kerry,&quot; said the servant, in an incredulous
and angry tone.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Indeed, I am doing no such thing. I did not
know there was any harm in reading those papers, and
I did so. But I did more than that, Kerry. I told
the story of the tragedy to Frank Linton; and he has
written a book on the trial.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A book! With the real names?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No! The names are fictitious, and the scene is
laid in a different place. But the whole story is told
in the novel.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Does the master know?&quot; asked Kerry, muttering
something between his teeth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He does now. Mr. Hilliston saw the book in
London, and came over to tell him, and to ask me to
say no more about it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What&#39;s that for, anyhow,&quot; demanded Kerry, who
seemed to scent new danger.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because Mr. Larcher is here!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Kerry flung up his hands with a cry of astonishment.
&quot;Mr. Larcher, miss! Who are you telling about?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Mr. Claude Larcher,&quot; said Jenny, rather
alarmed, for he had gripped her arm, &quot;the son of the
deceased man. He is staying at the Manor House
with Mr. Tait.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For a few minutes Kerry stood looking at the
ground in silence. Up to the present he had succeeded
in preserving his calm, but the last piece of
news upset him altogether, and he burst into violent
speech.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>[pg&nbsp;206]</span>
&quot;Augh! it&#39;s sorrow that is coming to this house,
and the black curse will be on the threshold. Cold
will the hearth be soon, and the old master will be
driven out. Ohone! and we and time will have sent
him into the cold world. Whirra! whirra!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jenny was so dumfounded by the unexpected eloquence
of the old man that she could do nothing but
stare at him. He caught her eye, and seeing that he
had been indiscreet in so betraying himself, he cut
short his lamentations, wiped his eyes, and relapsed
once more into the crusty, faithful Kerry whom she
knew. But he gave her a word of warning before he
took his departure. &quot;Say nothing of this, Miss
Jenny,&quot; he remarked; &quot;sure it&#39;s an old fool I am.
Keep a silent tongue as the master and lawyer wishes
you to do, and then, please the saints, things will go
the better.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But, Kerry, before you go, tell me. What is Mr.
Hilliston to my father?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is your father&#39;s best friend, miss,&quot; said Kerry,
with emphasis; &quot;his best and his worst,&quot; and with that
enigmatic reply he hurried off down the lane in the
direction of the vicarage, leaving Jenny in a state of
bewilderment.</p>

<p class="indent">She could understand nothing, and at that moment
sorely needed some friend with whom she could consult.
Kerry gave her no satisfaction, and spoke so
indefinitely that his conversation mystified in place of
enlightening her; it was no use to make a confidant
of Frank Linton, as notwithstanding his London reputation,
which she had greatly contributed to, Jenny did
not consider him sufficiently steady to be told of the
commotion raised by his novel in her immediate circle.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>[pg&nbsp;207]</span>
She could, therefore, discuss the matter with no one,
and so annoyed was she by the whole affair that she by
no means could bring herself to go back to the house
while Hilliston was yet there. He would be gone, she
trusted, in another half hour or so, and pending his
departure she strolled along the lane in the hope of
evading him.</p>

<p class="indent">But she only escaped Scylla to fall into Charybdis,
for, as she turned the corner, Tait and Claude met her
almost face to face. Jenny would have given much to
escape this awkward meeting, and intimated her wish
for solitude by passing the young men with a curt bow.
The sight of Claude, the memory of his father&#39;s death,
coupled with the suspicions she entertained, wrought
her up to a pitch of excitement which she had great
difficulty in concealing. She was, therefore, greatly
annoyed when Tait took off his hat, and placed himself
directly in her path. The little man thought it
was too favorable an opportunity for introduction to
be overlooked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t go away, Miss Paynton,&quot; he said, smiling.
&quot;I wish to introduce you to my friend Mr. Larcher.
Claude, this is Miss Paynton, of whom you have heard
me speak.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How do you do, Miss Paynton?&quot; said Claude,
with a suave bow. &quot;I hope you will pardon the
irregularity of this introduction.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This remark made Jenny laugh, and set her more at
ease. She was not particular as to forms and ceremonies
herself, and the idea that a young man should
apologize for such a trifle struck her as ridiculous.
Moreover, a glance assured her that Mr. Larcher was
by no means a formidable person. He was decidedly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>[pg&nbsp;208]</span>
good-looking, and had pleasant blue eyes, with a kindly
look, so speech and glance broke the ice at once between
them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you stay here long, Mr. Larcher?&quot; she asked,
pointedly ignoring her previous conversation with
Tait.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As long as I may,&quot; he replied, smiling. &quot;London
does not invite me at this time of the year. I prefer
the fragrant country to the dusty town.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is a true lover of the fields, Miss Paynton,&quot;
broke in Tait, admiring her self-possession, &quot;and
insisted that I should come out for a walk, so that he
might lose no time in steeping himself in the sweetness
of nature. Quite idyllic, isn&#39;t it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Quite!&quot; said Jenny lightly. &quot;Good-by at present,
Mr. Larcher! I am going to the vicarage, and
have not a moment to spare. Mr. Tait, can I speak
with you a minute?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tait obeyed with alacrity, and Claude was left to
muse on the fresh charm of Jenny, and the sweetness
of her voice. Her trim figure, her exquisite neatness,
and springing gait made him admire her greatly, and
when she tripped away with a smiling nod, he was so
taken up in watching her that he failed to observe the
grave face with which Tait joined him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As I thought,&quot; said the latter, when they resumed
their walk.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is up now?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, nothing more than usual! Hilliston has
called on Paynton already. He is there now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You don&#39;t say so! I did not think he would have
been so smart. However, you have stolen a march on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>[pg&nbsp;209]</span>
him. Do you intend to see him now? To wait his
coming out?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, no,&quot; said Tait, after a moment&#39;s deliberation.
&quot;Rather let us go home again that Hilliston may not
see us. I wish to wait and see what excuse he will
make for not calling on you. You&#39;ll get a letter full
of lies to-morrow, Claude.&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>[pg&nbsp;210]</span></p>

<h2><a name="chXXVII" id="chXXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>

<p class="h3">A GLIMPSE OF THE PAST.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Hilliston</span> remained a considerable time with his
friend, and it was not until sunset that he left the
house. He had a satisfied look on his face, as though
the interview had answered his expectations; and so
lifted up in spirit did he appear that he stepped out
into the lane as jauntily as though he were quite a
young man. It was over three miles to the railway
station, and he would be obliged to walk back; but the
prospect did not annoy him in the least; on the contrary
so great a load had been removed from his mind
by the late conversation that he felt fit to walk twice
the distance. Yet such unusual light-heartedness
might have recalled to his mind the Scotch superstition
regarding its probable reason.</p>

<p class="indent">As he walked smartly to the end of the lane, the sun
had just dropped behind the hills, leaving a trail of red
glory behind him. Against the crimson background
rose the gables and chimney of the Manor House, and
the sight recalled to Hilliston the fact that young
Larcher was staying in the mansion. He paused
doubtfully, not certain whether to go in or pass on;
for in his many schemes the least slip might prove
prejudicial to their accomplishment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If I call in I can say my visit here was to do so,&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211"></a>[pg&nbsp;211]</span>
he thought; &quot;but it is too late; and though Claude
might believe me, the little man would certainly be
suspicious. Besides they are sure to find out from
Jenny Paynton that I have seen her father. No! I
shan&#39;t go in, but to-night I will write a letter stating
that Paynton is a client whom I called to see about
business. I have made it all right there, and it will
take a cleverer man than Tait to upset my plans this
time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His meditations were interrupted by the rattle of
wheels, and he turned to see Kerry driving a dappled
pony in a small chaise. The old man distorted his
withered face into a grotesque grin of welcome, and
jumped out with extraordinary alacrity, when he came
alongside Hilliston.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Augh! augh, sir!&quot; said Kerry, touching his hat in
military fashion. &quot;It&#39;s a sight for sore eyes to see ye.
Miss Jenny told me you had walked over from the
station, so I just borrowed the trap of his riverence,
the vicar, to take you back.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is very kind of you, Kerry,&quot; replied Hilliston,
in his most genial manner; &quot;I am glad to accept
your offer and escape the walk. You drive and I&#39;ll sit
beside you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Kerry did as he was told, and in a few minutes the
trap containing the pair was rattling through the street
at a good pace. Shortly they left the village behind
and emerged into the open country. The road wound
to right and left, past farmhouses, under bending
trees, behind hedgerows, and occasionally passed over
a stone bridge spanning a trickling brook matted with
cresses. All this time neither of them had spoken, as
each was seemingly wrapped up in his own thoughts,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>[pg&nbsp;212]</span>
but as a matter of fact they were thinking of each
other. Kerry wished to speak to Hilliston, but did
not know how to begin; while Hilliston was in the
same predicament regarding Kerry.</p>

<p class="indent">It was the latter who finally began the conversation,
and he did so in a way which would have startled a
less brave man than the lawyer. At the moment they
were crossing a rather broad stream with a swift
current, and Kerry pulled up the pony midway between
the parapets of stone which protected the sides
of the rude bridge. Rather astonished at this stoppage,
for which he could assign no reason, Hilliston
roused himself from his musings and looked inquiringly
at Kerry. The man&#39;s eyes, significant and angry,
were fixed on him in anything but a friendly manner.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you know what I&#39;m thinking, sir?&quot; he said,
coolly flicking the pony&#39;s back with the whip.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, Kerry,&quot; replied Hilliston, with equal coolness.
&quot;Is it of anything important?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It might be to you, sir,&quot; replied Kerry dryly. &quot;I
was just thinking whether it wouldn&#39;t be a good thing
to send horse and trap and you and I into the water.
Then there would be an end to your black heart and
your black schemes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is very possible, Kerry,&quot; said Hilliston, who
knew his man, &quot;but before going to extremities you
had better make certain that you are acting for the
best. Without me your master is ruined.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We&#39;ll talk it over, sir,&quot; answered Kerry, and with
a smart flick of his whip sent the pony across the
bridge. When they were over and were trotting between
hedgerows he resumed the conversation.
&quot;Why have ye come here again, sir?&quot; he asked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>[pg&nbsp;213]</span>
abruptly. &quot;We were quit of you five years ago, and
now you come to harry the master once more.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I come for his own good, Kerry.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, now don&#39;t be after calling me Kerry. There&#39;s
no one here, and it is Denis Bantry I am to you, Mr.
Francis Hilliston.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The lawyer winced at the satirical emphasis placed on
the name, but judged it wise to humor the old man.
Kerry, as he called himself now, could be very obstinate
and disagreeable when he chose, so knowing his
powers in this respect Hilliston wisely conducted
the conversation on as broad lines as was possible.
Nevertheless, he carried the war into the enemy&#39;s
camp by blaming Kerry for not taking better care of
the bundle of papers which, through his negligence,
had fallen into the hands of Jenny.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And how was I to know, sir?&quot; retorted Kerry
querulously. &quot;The papers were safely put away in the
garret, and Miss Jenny had no call to go there.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, Kerry, you see what it has led to. The
account of the tragedy is all over London.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what of that, sir? Wasn&#39;t the account of it all
over Horriston twenty-five years ago?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No doubt,&quot; said Hilliston coolly; &quot;but that is all
over and done with. It is useless to dwell on the past
and its errors. But now Captain Larcher&#39;s son is bent
on finding out the truth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And why shouldn&#39;t he, sir?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t think you need ask the question, Kerry,&quot;
replied the lawyer, in so significant a tone that the old
servant turned away his head. &quot;It is not desirable
that Claude Larcher should be enlightened. We know
what took place on that night if no one else does, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214"></a>[pg&nbsp;214]</span>
for more reasons than one it is advisable that we should
keep our knowledge to ourselves.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Augh,&quot; said Kerry gruffly, &quot;you don&#39;t want it
known that you were in the garden on that night,
sir?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do not,&quot; answered Hilliston, with hasty emphasis.
&quot;I spoke falsely at the trial to save Mrs. Larcher.
I rather think you did so yourself, Kerry.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For the master&#39;s sake&mdash;for the master&#39;s sake! As
for the mistress she brought all the trouble on our
heads. I lied, sir, and you lied, but she wasn&#39;t worth
it. But is there to be trouble over it now, Mr.
Hilliston?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No. Not if you baffle the inquiries of those young
men at the Manor House. They will meet you and
question you, and get the truth out of you if they can.
Whether they do or not all depends upon yourself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You leave it to me, sir,&quot; said Kerry confidently.
&quot;I&#39;ll manage to send them away without being a bit
the wiser. And now, Mr. Hilliston, that this is settled,
I would speak to you about my sister Mona.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hilliston changed color, but nevertheless retained
sufficient composure to fix his eyes on the man&#39;s face
with a sad smile. &quot;What of her, Kerry?&quot; he asked,
in a melancholy tone; &quot;you know she is dead and gone.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Augh! Augh! But her grave, sir. You must
tell me where it is, for I have it in my mind to go and
see it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What would be the good of you doing that,&quot; said
Hilliston disapprovingly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because I was harsh with her, sir. If she did
wrong, she suffered for it, and it was wicked of me to
let her go as I did. Where is her grave, sir?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215"></a>[pg&nbsp;215]</span>
&quot;In Chiswick Cemetery,&quot; said Hilliston, as the
chaise stopped at the railway station; &quot;if you come up
to London and call at my office I will tell you where
to find it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Kerry was profuse in his thanks, and, touching his
hat gratefully, accepted the shilling which Hilliston
put into his hand; but when the train containing
Hilliston started for Eastbourne, he threw away the
money, and shook his fist after the retreating carriages.
Not a word did he say, but the frown on his face grew
deeper and deeper as he got into the trap again, and
drove slowly back to Thorston. Evidently he trusted
Hilliston no more than did Tait or Jenny.</p>

<p class="indent">It was now quite dark, for the daylight and afterglow
had long since vanished from the western skies,
and the moon was not yet up. Only the stars were
visible here and there in the cloudy sky, and finding
their light insufficient to drive by, Kerry got down
and lighted the carriage lamp. Heaven only knows
of what he was thinking as he drove along the dusky
lanes. The past unrolled itself before his eyes, and
what he saw there made him groan and heave deep
sighs. But there was no use in so indulging his
memories, and thinking of his master, Kerry braced
himself up to see what could be done toward meeting
the dangers which seemed to threaten on all sides.
When he delivered the trap again to the groom of the
vicar, he hit on an idea which he proceeded to carry
out.</p>

<p class="indent">Instead of going back at once to Rose Cottage, he
borrowed a piece of paper and a pencil from the groom,
and laboriously traced a few lines by the light of the
stable lantern. Putting this missive in his pocket, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page216" id="page216"></a>[pg&nbsp;216]</span>
went off in the direction of the Manor House; but
leaving the public road he skirted the low stone wall
which divided it from the adjacent fields. Kerry
knew every inch of the ground, and even in the darkness
had no difficulty in guiding himself to his destination.
This was a vantage point at the end of the wall,
whence he could see into a sitting room of the house.
In a few minutes Kerry was perched on this wall,
busily engaged in tying his letter to an ordinary sized
stone.</p>

<p class="indent">Almost immediately below him the mansion stretched
in a kind of abrupt right angle, in which was set two
wide windows overlooking a bed of flowers. These
were open to the cool night air, and the blinds had
been drawn down, so that Kerry from his lofty hiding-place
could see right into the room. A tall brass lamp
stood at one end, and under this sat Claude Larcher,
smoking and thinking. The glare of the lamp fell full
on his fresh-colored face and light hair, so that Kerry
felt as though he were gazing at a phantom out of that
dread past.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&#39;s as like his father as two peas,&quot; muttered
Kerry, devouring the picture with his eyes; &quot;a fine
boy and an honest gentleman. Augh! augh! To
think that I have nursed him on my knee when he was
a bit of lad, and now I&#39;m here telling him to go away.
But it&#39;s better that than the other. A curse on those
who brought him here and put sorrow into his heart.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Thus muttering, Kerry threw the stone lightly
through the window. It fell heavily on the floor
within a few feet of Claude, who sprang to his feet
with an exclamation. Not waiting to see the result,
Kerry hastily tumbled off the wall, jumped the ditch,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id="page217"></a>[pg&nbsp;217]</span>
and made off in the darkness. By a circuitous route
he regained Rose Cottage, and entered into the kitchen
worn out in body and mind. He had done his duty so
far as in him lay, and mentally prayed that the result
might tend to remove the threatened danger.</p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile Claude had picked up the stone and ran
to the window. He could see nothing, for Kerry was
already halfway across the fields; he could not even
guess whence the stone had been thrown. All was
silent, and though he listened intently, he could not
hear the sound of retreating footsteps. With some
wonderment he untied the paper from the stone and
smoothed it out. It was badly written and badly
spelled, and ran as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;Bewar of danger, Claude Larcher, tak a frind&#39;s
advise and go quick away.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">There was no signature, and the young man was
looking at it in growing perplexity when Tait entered
the room.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What did you shout out about?&quot; he asked carelessly.
&quot;I heard you in the next room.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You would have shouted also,&quot; replied Larcher,
holding out the paper. &quot;This was flung into the
room tied round a stone.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You don&#39;t say so! Who threw it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can&#39;t say. I rushed to the window at once, but
saw no sign of anyone. What do you think of the
hint therein contained?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tait read the anonymous communication, pondered
over it, and finally delivered his opinion by uttering
a name. &quot;Hilliston,&quot; he said confidently, &quot;Hilliston.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218"></a>[pg&nbsp;218]</span>
&quot;Nonsense!&quot; said Claude sharply; &quot;why should
he deal in underhand ways of this sort. If he wanted
me to go away, he could have called and urged me to
do so. But this&mdash;I don&#39;t believe Hilliston would condescend
to such trickery.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When a man is in a fix he will descend to anything
to get himself out of it,&quot; replied Tait, placing
the paper in his pocketbook. &quot;I&#39;ll keep this,
and, perhaps, before many days are over I&#39;ll have an
opportunity of proving to you that I speak truly.
Who else wants you to go away besides Hilliston.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Kerry&mdash;Denis Bantry might!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I doubt whether Kerry knows that you are here.
You must give matters time to develop themselves,
as the inmates of Rose Cottage can&#39;t know all about
us within twenty-four hours.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What between your confessions to Jenny, and
Hilliston&#39;s own knowledge, I think they&#39;ll know a
good deal in one way or another.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They can know as much as they like,&quot; said Tait
quietly, &quot;but we know more, and if it comes to a tug
of war I think you and I can win against Hilliston and
Co. But come outside and let us examine the top of
the wall.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you think the stone was thrown from there?&quot;
asked Claude, as they went out into the garden.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I fancy so from your description. Light this
candle.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The night was so still that the flame of the candle
hardly wavered. Tait gave it to Claude to hold, and
easily climbed up the wall by thrusting the toes of his
boots in among the loose stones. He examined the
top carefully, and then getting the light tied it to a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page219" id="page219"></a>[pg&nbsp;219]</span>
piece of string and lowered it on the other side. In
a few minutes he came down again with a satisfied
look.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As I thought,&quot; he said, blowing out the candle.
&quot;Someone has been on that wall and thrown the stone
from there. I saw the marks of feet on the other side.
The man who delivered the letter jumped the ditch
and made off across the fields.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You don&#39;t think it is Hilliston?&quot; said Claude
doubtfully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No; but I think it is an emissary of Hilliston.
Perhaps Denis Bantry.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tait!&quot; said Larcher, after a pause, &quot;from Hilliston&#39;s
visit to Paynton, from the way in which Paynton
persistently secludes himself from the world; and
from the knowledge we possess that the information
for Linton&#39;s book came out of that cottage, I have
come to a conclusion.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I believe that Ferdinand Paynton is none other
than Mark Jeringham, who killed my father.&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2><a name="chXXVIII" id="chXXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>

<p class="h3">PREPARING THE GROUND.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Aware</span> that Claude would hear sooner or later of
his visit to Paynton, the lawyer wrote to forestall the
information, skillfully alleging a business engagement
as his excuse for the visit. &quot;I would have called on
you,&quot; he continued, &quot;but that it was already late when
I left my client, Mr. Paynton, and I had to return to
Eastbourne in time for dinner. However, I hope to
come over again shortly, and then you must tell me
how you are getting on with your case. I am afraid
you will learn nothing at Thorston.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He knows better than that,&quot; said Tait, to whom
the letter was shown; &quot;he is aware that we have cut
the ground from under his feet so far as Jenny is concerned.
Moreover, I am certain that he is the author
of that anonymous letter of a few days since.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you really think he came here to ask Miss
Paynton to keep silence?&quot; asked Claude, returning
the letter to his pocket.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear fellow, I am certain of it. And he also
wishes to show us that he knows Paynton, so as to
warn us against asking questions in that quarter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Indeed, I think it is useless to do so,&quot; said Larcher
doubtfully; &quot;you know we called yesterday and were
refused admittance.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I spoke to Mr. Linton about that,&quot; replied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>[pg&nbsp;221]</span>
Tait easily; &quot;it seems that such is invariably the case,
as this hermit will see no one.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why? What can be his reason for such persistent
seclusion?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can&#39;t say, unless your surmise is correct, and he
is Jeringham.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am sure he is,&quot; said Claude emphatically.
&quot;Why was the bundle of newspapers containing an
account of the murder found in his house? What is
Denis Bantry doing there if Paynton is not Jeringham?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The shoe is on the other foot,&quot; remarked Tait
dryly. &quot;What is Denis Bantry doing there if Paynton
is Jeringham? You forget, Claude, that we suspect
Jeringham as the criminal. If this were so, or if
Paynton were Jeringham, I hardly think your father&#39;s
devoted servant would be at his beck and call, unless,&quot;
added Tait, as an after thought, &quot;Denis Bantry is also
implicated, as we imagine.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can&#39;t understand it,&quot; cried Claude, catching up
his hat; &quot;in place of growing clearer, the matter
seems to become more involved. How do you intend
to proceed? It seems to me that we are at a dead
stop.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;By no means, my dear fellow. There is Kerry,
alias Denis Bantry, to be examined. We must learn
the truth from him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He won&#39;t tell it! Particularly if our suspicions are
correct.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps not, but I have provided against that
failure. You must appeal to him as the son of his old
master, while I am absent.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Absent! Where are you going?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>[pg&nbsp;222]</span>
&quot;Can&#39;t you guess? To Horriston, of course, in
order to pick up what information I can. There are
sure to be people still alive who remember your father
and mother; who recollect the trial, and are still
acquainted with Mr. Hilliston. I expect to learn a
good deal about that gentleman there; and perhaps
something about Jeringham and his disappearance.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Humph! I doubt if you will be successful,&quot; replied
Claude gloomily; &quot;however, there is no harm in trying.
Where are we going now?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I told you before we set out. To call on the vicar.
As we can&#39;t see Jenny at her father&#39;s house we must
meet her in another person&#39;s. She is like a daughter
to Mrs. Linton, and is constantly at the vicarage.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And no doubt young Linton loves her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m sure he does. Have you any objection?&quot;
demanded Tait slyly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;None! None!&quot; said Claude hastily. &quot;I have
only met her for a few minutes, you know. But she
is a remarkably pretty girl, and from what you say
seems to be clever. Too good by half for that idiot.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Idiot! John Parver, novelist, the lion of the
season, an idiot? You forget he wrote the book of the
year.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So he says,&quot; responded Larcher dryly. &quot;But for
my part, I believe Jenny Paynton has more to do with
it than he. I have no doubt she wrote it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Further conversation was put an end to for the time
being by their arrival at the vicarage. Mr. Linton, a
stiff old gentleman with a severe face, received them
very kindly, and unbent so far as in him lay. He had
been acquainted with Tait for many years, and it was
during a visit to him that the little man had seen and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>[pg&nbsp;223]</span>
purchased Thorston Manor. Knowing him to be
wealthy, and being well disposed toward him for his
own sake, Mr. Linton was anxious to make the Lord
of the Manor at home in his house. Vicars cannot
afford to neglect opulent parishioners.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hope, Mr. Tait, that you will shortly take up
your abode altogether at the Manor,&quot; said he pompously.
&quot;I am not in favor of an absentee landlord.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, you&#39;ll see a good deal of me, Mr. Linton, I
assure you. I am too much in love with the beauties
of the place to stay long away. Moreover, I am not a
roamer like my friend Larcher here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is necessary with me,&quot; said Claude, smiling; &quot;I
assure you, sir, I am not the wandering vagabond Tait
would make me out to be.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is proper to see the world,&quot; said the vicar, with
heavy playfulness, &quot;and when you have made your
fortune in far countries, Mr. Larcher, you may settle
down in this favored spot.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I could wish for nothing better, Mr. Linton. But
the time is yet far off for that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My son is also fond of traveling,&quot; continued Mr.
Linton. &quot;Now that he is making a good income he
tells me that it is his intention to go to Italy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are proud of your son, Mr. Linton,&quot; said
Tait genially.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Without doubt! Without doubt! The book he
wrote is clever, although I do not care for sensational
writing myself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It pays. The taste of the age is in the direction
of sensationalism.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly, certainly. And I suppose it is only
natural that Francis should write some frivolity. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>[pg&nbsp;224]</span>
was never a deep scholar. What does astonish me,&quot;
added the vicar, raising his eyebrows, &quot;is that a
student like Mr. Paynton should desire to read the
book.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tait and Claude glanced at one another with the
same thought in their minds respecting this information.
Informed by Hilliston of the use made by
Linton of the Larcher affair, Paynton was anxious to
see in what light the case had been placed. This curiosity
argued that the recluse had been one of the
actors in the tragedy; if so, he could only be Jeringham,
since Captain Larcher was dead, and they knew
both Denis Bantry and Francis Hilliston. The vicar,
worthy man, was quite ignorant of the effect produced
by this announcement; nor was he undeceived by the
artful reply of Tait.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Naturally Mr. Paynton wants to read the book,&quot;
said the latter diplomatically. &quot;If I mistake not, he
has a great liking for Frank.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Indeed, yes,&quot; responded Mr. Linton thankfully.
&quot;He taught Francis Latin along with Jenny. He
would have made a scholar of him. I am indeed sorry
that my son failed to profit by his association with so
brilliant a student. He might have written a better
book.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Clearly the vicar was by no means impressed with the
sensationalism of &quot;A Whim of Fate,&quot; and would rather
his son had written an honest pamphlet or a grave
tragedy than have produced so meretricious a piece of
three-volume frivolity. However, he had no time to
talk further on this matter, for as he ended his speech
the subject of it entered the room with Jenny and
Mrs. Linton. The former started and flushed as she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>[pg&nbsp;225]</span>
saw Claude, and remembered his romantic history and
their former meeting.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My wife, Mr. Larcher. You know Mr. Tait of
course, my dear. Miss Paynton, Mr. Larcher, and
my son.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have already had the pleasure of meeting Mr.
Frank Linton in town,&quot; said Claude, holding out his
hand. The young author took it willingly enough, and
then the company resolved itself into two groups; the
vicar and his wife conversing with Tait, while Claude,
seconded by Frank, made himself agreeable to Jenny.
Neither the lady nor the author were pleased with this
arrangement, as the former felt uneasy when she
remembered her father&#39;s position, while the latter felt
jealous of Claude&#39;s superior good looks. Frank Linton
was, of course, ignorant that he was in the company
of the son of the Horriston victim; he did not even
know the names of the people or that of the place, and
had simply written the story on the meager information
afforded by Jenny. He could not, therefore,
understand the interest which those two displayed in
one another, and so grew jealous on seeing it.</p>

<p class="indent">It would be useless to report this conversation,
which in the main consisted of frivolities. Warned by
her father, Jenny was on her guard, and carefully
avoided any allusion to the Larcher affair. On his
part, not knowing the reticence Jenny had practised
with regard to Linton, Claude tried to lead the conversation
into a grove likely to deal with the novel and
case. At one point he did this so clumsily that Jenny
spoke outright on the subject.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let us talk no more of that, Mr. Larcher,&quot; she
said quietly. &quot;I told Mr. Tait all I knew the other day.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>[pg&nbsp;226]</span>
&quot;I have to thank you&mdash;&mdash;&quot; began Claude, when she
cut him short, and turned the conversation into
another channel. The young man was disappointed in
this, but nevertheless fell in with her humor, and when,
following Tait&#39;s example, he arose to go, he was quite
charmed with this country girl.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hope you will come soon again,&quot; said the vicar
hospitably, as he shook hands. &quot;We must have a
party shortly. Our friends, Mr. and Mrs. Hilliston,
have promised to come and stay the night during next
week.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Another move, and a foolish one,&quot; thought Tait,
but said aloud: &quot;We will be charmed, Mr. Linton, the
more so as Mr. Hilliston is my friend&#39;s guardian&mdash;or
rather was.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jenny looked startled at this, and her rich color
faded when she said good-by to Claude. The mystery
of the affair was beginning to worry her, and she could
by no means understand the relation of Hilliston to
Larcher; Hilliston, who was the guardian and friend;
Hilliston who, judging from the veto put on her speaking,
was inimical to Claude. Untroubled by their conversation
Claude held but one idea when he left the
house with Tait.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m afraid I am in love,&quot; said he, looking at his
friend.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What! at first sight? Impossible!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shakspere did not think so, or he would not have
written &#39;Romeo and Juliet.&#39; Yes, I believe I am in
love. Jenny is as fresh and fair, and pure and sweet
as a mountain daisy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You had better tell Linton so,&quot; said Tait dryly,
whereat Larcher laughed. He was too confident in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>[pg&nbsp;227]</span>
own powers to be timorous of rivalry with the celebrated
individual.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is no need to tell him,&quot; he said lightly; &quot;the
poor man was eaten up with jealousy when I spoke to
Miss Paynton. By the way, did you see that she
changed color when you mentioned that Hilliston had
been my guardian?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was natural that she should. Hilliston is a
suspicious person in her eyes, and this discovery will
perplex her still more regarding his relations with you.
Jenny is a very clever young woman, but I wonder if
she is clever enough to put this and that together.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To arrive at what conclusion?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;At the most logical conclusion. That her father is
Jeringham, whom she suspects of the crime.&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="chXXIX" id="chXXIX"></a>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>

<p class="h3">KERRY.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Having</span>, as he considered, prepared the ground by
acquainting Claude with the notabilities of the neighborhood,
Tait next proceeded to secure an interview
with Kerry. This was by no means an easy matter, as,
either by accident or design, Kerry eluded all the young
men&#39;s attempts to interview him. Hitherto he had
been accustomed to fish daily in the Lax, but now,
doubtless by direction of his master, he forsook his
customary sport for some considerable time. His
absence speedily roused Tait&#39;s suspicions.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hilliston has succeeded well,&quot; said he, after one of
these futile attempts to see the old servant. &quot;He has
put Jeringham on his guard.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Paynton, you mean,&quot; observed Claude, looking up
from his plate. They were at breakfast when this
conversation took place.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thought you had determined in your own mind
that he was Jeringham.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; said Claude, coloring a little; &quot;I have come
round to your opinion in the matter. If Paynton were
Jeringham, I don&#39;t think Denis Bantry would be in
his service.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah!&quot; remarked Tait sarcastically, &quot;is that the
result of reflection or of love?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of love? I don&#39;t understand you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>[pg&nbsp;229]</span>
&quot;Yes, you do, Claude. You are in love with Jenny.
The last week has only deepened your first impressions.
I believe she likes you also, and so I foresee a
marriage which will rob me of my friend.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am not so certain of that as you are,&quot; said
Larcher, after a pause. &quot;Miss Paynton has given me
no hint of her feelings, and our acquaintance is yet
young. Even if I did design to make her my wife, I
would have to gain her consent, and that of her father.
Judging from Paynton&#39;s present attitude that consent
would most probably be refused.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tait did not immediately reply, but stared out of
the window with an absent look in his eyes. The
remark changed the current of his ideas.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wonder who Paynton can be?&quot; he said at length,
with some hesitation. &quot;That he is connected with
the case I am certain from the way in which he has
profited by the warning of Hilliston. Like yourself, I
have my doubts regarding his identity with Jeringham,
because of Denis Bantry. Who is he? I must go to
Horriston to-morrow and find out.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what am I to do in the meantime?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hunt out Kerry and learn the truth,&quot; said Tait
coolly. &quot;I think, after all, it will be best for you to
see him alone. I am a stranger, and he won&#39;t speak
before me; but to you, the son of his old master, he
may open his heart. Once he does that you may learn
the truth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I doubt it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, there is a chance. Whatever tie binds
Denis to Paynton, you must not forget that he is Irish.
The Irish are an impulsive and excitable race, so it is
just possible that his feelings may carry him away in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230"></a>[pg&nbsp;230]</span>
your presence, and he may tell you all we wish to
know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you think he can solve the mystery?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. He was in the house when Jeringham came
home with your mother; he picked up the garnet pin,
and, it may be, can tell us to whom it belongs. It may
be the property of Hilliston, as is stated in the novel;
on the other hand it may belong to your father or to
Jeringham. Of one point I am sure, the person who
owned the pin killed your father. Kerry, or rather
Denis Bantry, knows the owner, and consequently the
murderer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If so, why did he not denounce him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There you puzzle me,&quot; said Tait, rising to his
feet; &quot;that is one of the many mysteries of this case.
Only Denis can explain, and he may do so to you. I
shall stay at home this morning, and prepare for my
journey to Horriston; but you had better take your
fishing rod and go to your post.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The post alluded to was on the banks of the Lax,
where for the past week the young men had patiently
waited for the appearance of Denis. On this morning
Claude found himself alone for the first time; and sat
down with a disconsolate air, for he had little hope
that Denis would make his appearance. In this surmise
he was wrong, for scarcely had he been seated
half an hour when the Irishman came slowly along on
the opposite bank of the river.</p>

<p class="indent">He was a little old man, gray as a badger, with
stooped shoulders, and a cross-looking face. Without
vouchsafing a look in Claude&#39;s direction, he prepared
his fishing tackle and began industriously to whip the
stream. Hardly knowing how to break the ice, Larcher
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page231" id="page231"></a>[pg&nbsp;231]</span>
silently continued his sport, and the two, divided by
the water, stood like statues on opposite banks.</p>

<p class="indent">After a time Denis, who had been cunningly taking
stock of Claude, and wondering why his letter had not
produced the effect intended, moved down to where
the stream narrowed itself between large stones.
Determined to invent some excuse for speaking,
Larcher followed after a time, and stepped out on to a
bowlder, apparently to throw his line into a likely
looking pool. Being within reach, he flung his line,
and the next moment it was entangled in that of
Kerry&#39;s.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m sorry! Quite an accident,&quot; said Claude, noting
the wrath on Kerry&#39;s face. &quot;Let me disentangle it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He jumped into the brown water and, before Kerry
could make any objection, was across on the other
side, gripping the lines. Without a word the Irishman
let him separate the two lines, and then busied
himself with fixing a fly. Nettled at this determined
silence Claude spoke.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wish to speak with you,&quot; he said, tapping the
other on the shoulder.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is it to me ye speak?&quot; replied Kerry, with an
admirable look of surprise; &quot;and what has the like of
you, sir, to say to me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A great deal. Do you know who I am?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sure, an&#39; I do, sir. The friend of Mr. Tait, you
are no less.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But my name. Do you know it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bad luck to this stream, there&#39;s never a fish in it,&quot;
grumbled Kerry, with a convenient attack of deafness.</p>

<p class="indent">Claude was in nowise angered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is very clever, Kerry,&quot; he said; &quot;but&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id="page232"></a>[pg&nbsp;232]</span>
&quot;An&#39; how do you know my name is Kerry?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you surprised that I should know it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am that,&quot; replied Kerry sharply. &quot;I never set
eyes on you before.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes, you did&mdash;twenty-five years ago.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Begorra, that&#39;s a lie, anyhow!&quot; muttered Kerry,
under his breath, with an uneasy wriggle.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is not a lie, and you know it, my man,&quot; said
Larcher firmly; &quot;it is no use your pretending ignorance.
I know who you are.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Devil a doubt of it! Kerry, you called me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes! Because you are known by that name here.
But at Horriston&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Claude stopped. He saw the hands of the old man
grip the rod so tight that the knuckles whitened.
The name had produced the effect he intended. So,
almost without a pause, he continued, and aimed
another blow at Kerry&#39;s imperturbability. &quot;At Horriston,&quot;
he resumed, &quot;you were known as Denis
Bantry.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Was I, now?&quot; said Kerry, prepared for the attack.
&quot;Augh, to think of it! And where might Horriston
be, sir?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You ought to know that, Denis.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your honor will be after giving me the name of a
friend of yours.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Quite right,&quot; rejoined Claude, seizing the opportunity.
&quot;You were&mdash;nay, you are&mdash;a friend of mine.
I am the little lad you carried in your arms&mdash;to whom
you told stories, and sang songs. Children forget a
great deal, but I have not forgotten you, Denis.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In dogged silence the old man turned his head away,
intently bent on his sport, but suddenly he raised the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id="page233"></a>[pg&nbsp;233]</span>
cuff of his coat and wiped away a betraying tear.
Seeing that he had touched the man&#39;s sympathy, Claude
followed up his advantage.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are not going to deny me, Denis, are you?&quot;
he said entreatingly. &quot;I am down here on an errand
which you must guess. If Hilliston&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The curse of Cromwell on him!&quot; said Kerry, under
his breath.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If Hilliston told you to keep silent,&quot; said Claude,
affecting to take no notice of the interjection, which
confirmed his suspicions, &quot;I, the son of your dead
master, want you to speak. I wish to find out who
killed my father. I wish to punish him, for you know
his name.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Kerry turned furiously on the young man, but it
seemed to Claude that his anger was feigned to hide
a deeper emotion.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is a dirty informer you&#39;d have me be,&quot; he cried,
with a stamp of his foot, &quot;to betray him whose bread
I eat. I&#39;ll tell you nothing, for it&#39;s that much I
know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Denis&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m not Denis! It&#39;s Kerry I am. I know nothing
of Horriston, or of you, sir. Go away with ye, young
gentleman, and don&#39;t be after disgracing an old servant
to play the spy and cheat.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then, still breathing fury, he rushed away, but
paused some distance off to raise his hands to the
sky with an appealing gesture. The impulsive Irish
nature had broken through diplomatic reserve, and,
fearful of saying too much, Kerry saved himself by
flight. Claude guessed this and forebore to follow
him.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id="page234"></a>[pg&nbsp;234]</span>
&quot;I have broken the ice at all events,&quot; he said to
himself, when returning to the Manor to tell Tait.
&quot;The next time I may be fortunate enough to force
the truth out of him. He knows it, I am certain. He
hates Hilliston and loves me. I can easily guess with
whom he sympathizes, in spite of his master. He is
Denis, sure enough, but who is Paynton?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was impossible to say.</p>

<h2><a name="chXXX" id="chXXX"></a>CHAPTER XXX.</h2>

<p class="h3">MRS. BEZEL AGAIN.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">On</span> returning home Claude found that Tait, contrary
to his expressed intention, had gone out. Dormer,
who was packing a portmanteau for the Horriston
journey, could not inform Larcher when his master
would be back, but ventured an opinion that he would
certainly return to luncheon. Meanwhile, he handed
to Claude some letters which had just arrived, and
with these the young man managed to pass a fairly
uncomfortable hour. Uncomfortable, because one of
the letters was from Mrs. Bezel, and proved of so
puzzling a character that Larcher was in a fever of
impatience to discuss it with Tait.</p>

<p class="indent">The little man returned to luncheon, as was surmised
by Dormer, and was met in the hall by Claude
with the open letter of Mrs. Bezel in his hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear fellow, why did you go out?&quot; said
Larcher complainingly. &quot;I have so much to tell you.
I have seen Kerry, and now here is a letter from Mrs.
Bezel.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What! is she on the stage again?&quot; said Tait
eagerly. &quot;Let me see the letter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not yet,&quot; replied Claude, putting it promptly
behind his back. &quot;You must first tell me why you
left the house, when you ought to be packing up for
Horriston.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>[pg&nbsp;236]</span>
Tait shrugged his shoulders, bowed to the inevitable,
and went into the dining room. Here he sat at the
table and began to carve some cold beef, thereby
throwing Claude into a rage.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You cold-blooded little monster,&quot; he cried, tapping
on the table, &quot;will you satisfy my curiosity?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why should I?&quot; said Tait, grinning. &quot;You won&#39;t
satisfy mine.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then read the letter,&quot; retorted Claude, throwing
it across the table. To his surprise Tait placed it on
one side.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not yet!&quot; he said, resuming his carving. &quot;We
must have a talk first. Have some beef.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t want beef, but information.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You shall have both,&quot; said Tait calmly. &quot;Do
you prefer beer or claret?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Beer!&quot; replied Larcher resignedly, falling in with
the tricksey humor of his friend. Tait was a man with
whom it was impossible to quarrel.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dormer, fill Mr. Larcher&#39;s glass; put the claret
jug beside me, and leave the room. We will wait on
ourselves.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">As stolid as a wooden image Dormer obeyed these
instructions, and wheeled out of the room. Tait ate a
few mouthfuls of beef, drank a glass of claret, and prepared
to talk. His first remark was a bombshell.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have seen Paynton,&quot; said he slowly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The deuce you have!&quot; cried Claude, in surprise;
&quot;and how did you manage to take his castle by
storm?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Easily enough, by the help of a lie and a little
strategy. I went out to see if you were at your post,
and caught sight of Kerry crossing the fields. As I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page237" id="page237"></a>[pg&nbsp;237]</span>
knew Jenny would be at the Lintons&#39;,&mdash;for she goes
there to see the old lady every morning,&mdash;I guessed
that Rose Cottage would be undefended; so back I ran
to the house, picked up a book which I had promised
to lend the young lady, and went to pay my visit.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How did you get inside the gate? It is generally
locked.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It wasn&#39;t on this occasion,&quot; replied Tait complacently.
&quot;I opened it and walked in, to find old
Paynton strolling in the garden. Catching sight of
me, he turned back to re-enter the house, but, luckily,
I was between him and the door, so we met face to
face.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What kind of a man is he to look at?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, a fine-looking old chap, with white hair and
beard, a skullcap, and a dressing gown. Quite the
get up of a necromancer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did he speak to you,&quot; asked Claude, having considered
this description.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He asked me politely what my business was;
whereupon I presented the book, and mentioned that
it was for his daughter. He replied that she was at
the Lintons&#39;, and would be back soon, when he would
give her the book himself. Then he asked me to
excuse him, and bowed me out of the gate. But,&quot;
added Tait, with emphasis, &quot;not before I had mentioned
that Mr. Claude Larcher was staying with me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did my name produce any effect?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Rather! Paynton changed color, and mumbled
something unintelligible. Then he turned his back
and walked quickly into the house, leaving me to close
the gate myself. Depend upon it, he knows something,
Claude.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page238" id="page238"></a>[pg&nbsp;238]</span>
&quot;But his name isn&#39;t mentioned in connection with
the case.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course not. Paynton is a feigned one. And,
as I have said before, there are, no doubt, actors in the
tragedy of whom we know nothing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is one of that sort mentioned here,&quot; said
Larcher, picking up Mrs. Bezel&#39;s letter. &quot;Read that,
Tait, and see what you make of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It proved to be a short note, hastily written, and ran
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;<span class="smcap">My Dear Claude</span>:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you are still in doubt as to who murdered your
father, ask Mr. Hilliston to tell you about Louisa
Sinclair, who lived at Horriston twenty-five years ago.
She knows.</p>

<p class="center">&quot;Your affectionate mother,</p>

<p class="right">&quot;<span class="smcap">Margaret Bezel</span>.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">&quot;Louisa Sinclair,&quot; repeated Tait slowly, having
mastered the contents of this letter. &quot;No, I never
heard of her. It is strange that Hilliston has never
mentioned her name.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No doubt he had good reasons for not doing so,&quot;
said Claude bitterly. &quot;You need not look so astonished,
Tait. I have long ago come round to your
opinion of my old guardian. His intimacy with Paynton
and the effect of his visit on Kerry would convince
me&mdash;not to speak of that &#39;anonymous letter.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah! Kerry refused to speak.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He would not say a word, and, moreover, stated
that he was not Denis Bantry; that he had never heard
of Horriston. In fact, he acted his part excellently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>[pg&nbsp;239]</span>
well till the last. Then he broke down, and, afraid of
letting the cat out of the bag, he ran away.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Exactly what his master did,&quot; said Tait thoughtfully.
&quot;Depend upon it, Claude, we will learn the
truth from one of those two.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you think so, why go to Horriston?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because I want to learn the real name of Paynton,
and, moreover, here is an additional reason. I must
find out Louisa Sinclair.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is no mention of her in the case.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Quite true. And there is no mention of Paynton;
but for all that he knows about it. Oh, you may be
sure there are circumstances to be discovered at Horriston
which never came to light at the trial.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My mother is anxious for the mystery to be
cleared up.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So I see, and I am glad of it,&quot; said Tait, with an
affectation of carelessness. &quot;I thought she was too
ill to take an interest in the matter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Am I to ask Hilliston about this woman?&quot; said
Claude, looking up in some doubt.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; replied his friend, after a few moments&#39; deliberation.
&quot;Our success in this depends on keeping
Hilliston in the dark concerning our movements. If
we tell him too much he may thwart us, as he has done
already in this Paynton business. Say nothing about
Louisa Sinclair, or about my visit to Horriston. Tell
him I have gone to town, and let him figure out the reason
for himself. By the way, when do you see him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;On Friday evening. Both he and his wife are
coming to dine, and stop all night at the vicarage.
You may be sure Hilliston will put me through a
thorough cross-examination regarding your absence.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>[pg&nbsp;240]</span>
&quot;Refer him to Mr. Linton,&quot; said Tait coolly. &quot;I
am writing to that gentleman, telling him I am unexpectedly
called to town on particular business. What
that business is Hilliston will be anxious to know. I
don&#39;t think he&#39;ll enjoy his evening at all. A guilty
conscience mars all pleasure.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When do you leave?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;By the 4.20 train this afternoon. I&#39;ll write you
about my discoveries as soon as I find out anything
worth scribbling about.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;ll find nothing,&quot; said Claude dolefully;
&quot;after five-and-twenty years.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll find out who Louisa Sinclair is, and then
astonish Hilliston with the extent of my information.
Regarding Paynton, I am not so certain. That discovery
rests between you and Denis Bantry.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll do my best, but I am doubtful,&quot; replied
Claude, and so the conversation terminated for the
time being. It left a lasting impression on the two
who took part in it.</p>

<p class="indent">Tait duly took his departure with Dormer, leaving
Claude in possession of the house. As he leaned out
of the window of the smoking carriage, he said a last
word to his friend:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t tell Hilliston about my going to Horriston,&quot;
he said significantly; &quot;but if you get a chance inform
his wife of the fact.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll tell you that when I come back,&quot; said Tait,
as the train moved slowly off. &quot;Give her the information,
and observe the effect; it will astonish you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Tait counted without his host; he was ignorant
of Mrs. Hilliston&#39;s powers of self-control.</p>

<h2><a name="chXXXI" id="chXXXI"></a>CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>

<p class="h3">AN EVENING AT THE VICARAGE.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> Vicar of Thorston was a severe man, a trifle
narrow in his views, and imperious of temper; but he
was also fond of good cheer and hospitality&mdash;virtues
which cover a multitude of sins. Those who sat at
his table were sure of a capital dinner and an excellent
glass of wine; for his cook and cellar were both
undeniable. Report said that Mr. Linton was afraid
of his cook, for that good lady had a hot temper, and
feared no man. Many were the battles between her
and the vicar, but being a perfect mistress of the
culinary art, she invariably came off victor. She had
her faults, but she was a jewel of a cook, and was
valued accordingly.</p>

<p class="indent">On this special evening the vicar had assembled ten
people, including himself, round his hospitable board.
Mr. and Mrs. Hilliston were the principal guests, and
Claude was also honored with special attention. An
old couple named Densham, garrulous and pleasant,
had likewise been invited; and they, with their
daughter and Jenny Paynton, completed the party.
To Claude was assigned Miss Paynton, while to Frank
Linton was given the Densham damsel, an arrangement
which was anything but pleasing to that jealous
young man, or indeed to Miss Densham, who thought
the famous author a grumpy creature. He was too
preoccupied to please her taste.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>[pg&nbsp;242]</span>
Claude thought he had never seen Mrs. Hilliston to
such disadvantage. She appeared ill at ease, and was
haggard and pale of face, looking every year of her
age. Even the rich dress and splendid jewels she
wore failed to conceal the ravages of time; and in the
neighborhood of the fresh beauty of the two girls she
seemed an old woman. She felt this herself, for
Claude noted that she threw an envious glance at the
blooming faces of her rivals, and surveyed her wan
looks in the nearest glass with a sigh. To her the
party was purgatory.</p>

<p class="indent">Nor did the lawyer appear to enjoy himself. He
was moody and fretful, though every now and then he
forced himself to be merry, but his laugh was hollow,
and the careworn expression of his face belied his
untimely mirth. Sometimes he stole a furtive look at
Claude, and seemed to brood over the young man&#39;s
changed manner; for, do what he could, Larcher,
deeming his old friend an enemy, could not behave
with his former cordiality. He was ill-suited for a
diplomat.</p>

<p class="indent">The dinner passed off with moderate success. Frank
was complimented on his book, and the prosy couple
had to be told the main points of the story. This
brief recital made at least three people uncomfortable;
for Claude raised his eyes to encounter an angry glance
from Hilliston, and a deprecating one from Jenny.
They were relieved when the vicar, who by no means
approved of such attention being bestowed on a trashy
novel, even though his son was the author, turned the
conversation into another channel. Mr. Linton liked
to lead the conversation at his own table.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wish to speak to you particularly, Claude,&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>[pg&nbsp;243]</span>
whispered Mrs. Hilliston, as he held the door open for
the ladies to retire; &quot;do not be long over your wine.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will come as soon as I can,&quot; he replied, and
returned to his seat, wondering what she could have
to say to him. He was not left long in doubt, for Mr.
Hilliston entered into conversation as soon as the
glasses were filled and the cigars lighted. This was
the moment for which he had longed for the whole
evening.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why isn&#39;t your friend Tait here to-night?&quot; he
asked, in a casual tone, feigning a lightness he did not
feel.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did not Mr. Linton tell you?&quot; replied Claude,
prepared for this query. &quot;He had to go to town on
business.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;On business,&quot; murmured Hilliston uneasily; &quot;anything
to do with this case you have taken up?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can&#39;t say. Tait did not particularly state his
errand.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The lawyer sipped his wine, looked thoughtfully at
the end of the cigar, and pondered for a few minutes.
He wished to speak of Claude&#39;s changed behavior
toward himself, yet did not know how to begin. At
length he bluntly blurted out a question, straightforward
and to the point. This was undiplomatic, but
at times human nature is too strong for training.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We are not such good friends as of yore, Claude.
How is that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think you can guess the reason,&quot; replied Larcher,
not ill pleased to fight out the point, for he hated
being forced into doubtful civility. &quot;It is this case
which has come between us. I do not think you are
giving me what help you ought to, Mr. Hilliston.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page244" id="page244"></a>[pg&nbsp;244]</span>
&quot;I can give you no help,&quot; said the lawyer, drawing
his heavy brows together. &quot;You know as much as I
do. No doubt your meddlesome friend knows more.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is not improbable. But you can prove your
honesty in the matter by doing me a favor.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My honesty, sir, has never been called into question
yet,&quot; said Hilliston, injudiciously losing his temper,
always a prelude to defeat. &quot;And I have no call to
defend myself to one to whom I have been a father.
Still I am willing to grant you what you wish, in
reason.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very good! Then introduce me to Mr. Paynton.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m afraid that is out of my power,&quot; replied Hilliston,
shaking his head. &quot;You know the man&#39;s ways,
I think. He is a hermit, a misanthrope, and does
not care for company. Why do you wish to know
him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For various reasons,&quot; answered Larcher, coloring
with some embarrassment. He was by no means willing
to take Mr. Hilliston into his confidence.</p>

<p class="indent">His old guardian looked at him shrewdly, and,
remembering certain small circumstances connected
with Jenny, guessed, with the skill of an experienced
character reader, how the land lay. At once he
formed a resolution to further Claude&#39;s interests in
the matter, hoping, and not unjustly, that should the
lad be taken in the toils of love, he might stop further
investigation of the case, an end which Hilliston
much desired to gain.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh!&quot; said he not unkindly, &quot;sits the wind in
that quarter? Well, I will aid you. In a few days
I will try and induce Mr. Paynton to see you, and
then perhaps you may succeed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245"></a>[pg&nbsp;245]</span>
&quot;Succeed in what?&quot; demanded Claude sharply,
hardly relishing this perspicuity.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, in this love-suit of yours. Aye, aye, Claude,
I can see what you aim at, old as I am. Well, she
is a pretty girl, clever and worthy. I know of no
woman who would make you a better wife. You have
my best wishes for your success.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you will introduce me to her father?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll try to, but I won&#39;t promise confidently.
Paynton is a strange creature and may refuse to
see you. By the way,&quot; added Hilliston, as though
struck with a sudden thought, &quot;what was my wife
saying to you at the door?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She was requesting me to speak to her in the
drawing room. There is nothing wrong, I hope?
She does not look well.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, nothing wrong, nothing wrong!&quot; replied
Hilliston easily, rising to his feet as the vicar
moved toward the door. &quot;She is fond of you, my
dear boy, and is anxious about the case.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Anxious about the case,&quot; thought Larcher, as he
followed his host into the drawing room; &quot;that is
strange. She can have no interest in it. H&#39;m! I&#39;ll
try the effect of Tait&#39;s destination on her. He said
I would be astonished at the result. I am beginning
to be so already.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Perhaps Jenny had overheard the whisper in the
dining room, and was sufficiently taken with Larcher
to be jealous of his attentions to Mrs. Hilliston, old
though she deemed her, for, before he could cross over
to where the lawyer&#39;s wife was seated, Jenny beckoned
to him with her imperious finger. He could do nothing
but obey, despite the frown which darkened Mrs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>[pg&nbsp;246]</span>
Hilliston&#39;s face, as she saw, and, with womanly
instinct, guessed the maneuver.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come and sit down here,&quot; whispered Jenny, under
cover of the music, for Miss Densham was at the
piano. &quot;I have not seen you for several days.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is not my fault,&quot; said Claude, delighted at the
interest thus displayed; &quot;you stay so much indoors.
I have been looking for you everywhere.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you, indeed, Mr. Larcher?&quot; said Jenny,
with feigned surprise. &quot;And why, may I ask?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, for no particular purpose, unless, indeed, it
was to ask you for further information concerning the
novel.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hush. Not a word of that. I can&#39;t speak of it to
you. I know who you are, Mr. Larcher, but I am
ignorant of the tragedy save what I told to Frank, and
later on to Mr. Tait.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you can guess&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can guess nothing,&quot; interrupted the girl imperiously.
&quot;If you and I are to remain friends you must
cease talking on that subject.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll do anything to remain friends with you, Miss
Paynton,&quot; was the significant reply.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then talk of anything save that terrible case. Oh,
how I wish I had left it alone!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m glad you did not,&quot; said Claude bluntly. &quot;If
it had not been for that book&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Before he could finish the sentence Jenny shot an
indignant look at him, and deliberately rising from her
seat crossed the room to where Frank Linton was
frowning and tugging at his mustache. Claude was
vexed at his folly in thus drawing down her anger on
him, but accepted his beating like a man, and passed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>[pg&nbsp;247]</span>
over to where Mrs. Hilliston waited with an expectant
face. She remarked on his tardy coming with some
bitterness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I see you prefer a younger face to mine,&quot; she said,
drawing herself up. &quot;Time was when I had no rival
to fear.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dear Mrs. Hilliston, I could not disobey a lady.
Besides&mdash;besides&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Besides you are in love with her. Oh, I can see
that! Well, she is a pretty girl. So you intend to
marry her?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is early yet to talk of marriage. I don&#39;t even
know if she likes me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Hilliston laughed, and looked at him smilingly.
&quot;Then you must be very ignorant of the way of women,
my dear,&quot; she said meaningly. &quot;A word in your ear,
Claude. That girl loves you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In two weeks! Impossible!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ve known love to grow in two days,&quot; replied Mrs.
Hilliston dryly. &quot;Oh, yes, she loves you, and you
love her, so you can marry as soon as you choose.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;First I must get Mr. Paynton&#39;s consent.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should not think that would be difficult,&quot; said
the lady, looking at his eager face. &quot;You are young,
not ill-looking, not badly off, and so I should not think
Mr. Paynton would desire anything better for his
daughter. So much for the first obstacle, and the
second?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I must solve the mystery of my father&#39;s death.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Hilliston&#39;s manner changed on the instant, and
from being gay she became severe and anxious-looking.
Indeed, Claude thought that she paled under her
rouge; but this might have been fancy.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id="page248"></a>[pg&nbsp;248]</span>
&quot;It is about that I wish to speak to you,&quot; she said
hurriedly. &quot;I want you to stop investigating this
case. You will learn nothing; it would be of no use
to anyone if you did solve the mystery. Stop troubling
yourself with slander, Claude.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why?&quot; he asked, astonished at her earnest tone.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because your conduct vexes my husband. He has
been a father to you in the place of the one you lost,
so you ought to consider him a little. Pray leave that
mystery unsolved.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If I would, Tait would not. He is now even more
eager than I to find out the truth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Horrid little man!&quot; said the lady viciously.
&quot;Where is he now?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The time had now come to try the effect of Tait&#39;s
destination, and fixing his eyes on Mrs. Hilliston as she
slowly fanned herself, Claude uttered the fatal words.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is at Horriston.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The fan stopped, Mrs. Hilliston paled, but, preserving
her self-control with a strong effort, replied
quietly:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;At Horriston. And why?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To find out a person not mentioned in the case.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Man or woman?&quot; asked Mrs. Hilliston in a low
voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Woman.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She said no more, but turned away her head to reply
to her husband, who came up opportunely. He also
had heard the last few words of the conversation, and,
ignoring the presence of Claude, husband and wife
looked at one another with pale faces.</p>

<p class="indent">The shot had struck home, and Larcher saw that it
had.</p>

<h2><a name="chXXXII" id="chXXXII"></a>CHAPTER XXXII.</h2>

<p class="h3">THE DISCOVERIES OF SPENSER TAIT.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Horriston</span> might fitly be compared to Jonah&#39;s
gourd; it sprang up in a night, so to speak, and
withered in the space of a day. In the earlier part of
the Victorian era a celebrated doctor recommended its
mineral springs, and invalids flocked to be cured at
this new pool of Bethesda. Whether the cures were
not genuine, or insufficiently rapid to please the sick
folk, it is hard to say, but after fifteen or twenty years
of prosperity the crowd of fashionable valetudinarians
ceased to occupy the commodious lodging houses and
hotels in Horriston. Other places sprang up with
greater attractions and more certain cures, so the erstwhile
fashionable town relapsed into its provincial dullness.
No one lived there but a few retired army men,
and no one came save a stray neurotic person in search
of absolute quiet. Few failed to get that at Horriston,
which was now as sleepy a place as could be found in
all England. Even Thorston was more in touch with
the nineteenth century than this deserted town.</p>

<p class="indent">As Tait drove through the streets on his way to the
principal hotel, he could not help noticing the dreary
look of the chief thoroughfare. Many of the shops
were closed, some were unoccupied, and those still
open displayed wares grimy and flyblown. The shopkeepers
came to their doors in a dazed fashion to look
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250"></a>[pg&nbsp;250]</span>
at the new visitor in the single fly which plied between
station and hotel, thereby showing that the event was
one of rare occurrence. There were no vehicles in
the street itself save a lumbering cart containing
market produce, and the doctor&#39;s trap which stood at
the doctor&#39;s door. A few people sauntered along the
pavement in a listless fashion, and the whole aspect of
the place was one of decay and desertion. But for the
presence of shopkeepers and pedestrians, few though
they were, Tait could almost have imagined himself
in some deserted mining township on the Californian
coast.</p>

<p class="indent">The principal hotel faced one side of a melancholy
square, and was called &quot;The Royal Victoria,&quot; out of
compliment to the reigning monarch. It was a large
barrack, with staring windows, and a flight of white
steps leading up to a deserted hall. No busy waiters,
no genial landlord or buxom barmaid, not even the
sound of cheerful voices. Cats slept on the steps and
fowls clucked in the square, while a melancholy waiter,
peering out of the window, put the finishing touch to
the lamentable dreariness of the scene. The sign
&quot;Royal Victoria&quot; should have been removed out of
very shame, and the word &quot;Ichabod&quot; written up in
its place. The landlord was lacking in humor to let
things remain as they were.</p>

<p class="indent">However, Tait, being hungry and dusty and tired,
consoled himself with the reflection that it was at all
events an hotel, and speedily found himself the sole
occupant of the dining room, attended to by the
melancholy waiter. The viands provided were by no
means bad, and the wine was undeniably good; and
small wonder, seeing it had been in the cellars for a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251"></a>[pg&nbsp;251]</span>
quarter of a century for want of someone to drink
it. This fact was confided to Tait by his sad Ganymede.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We used to see a sight of company here,&quot; said
this elderly person when he appeared with the claret,
&quot;but, bless you, it&#39;s like Babylon the fallen now, sir.
You&#39;re the first gentleman as I have seen here for a
week.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shouldn&#39;t think it would pay to keep the hotel
open.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It don&#39;t, sir,&quot; replied the waiter with conviction,
&quot;but master is well off&mdash;made his money in the days
when Horriston was Horriston, and keeps this place
as a sort of hobby. We have a club here in the evenings,
sir, and that makes things a bit lively.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you been here long?&quot; asked Tait, noticing
how gray and wrinkled was this despondent servitor.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Over thirty years, sir,&quot; responded Ganymede,
with a sigh as though the memory was too much for
him; &quot;man and boy I&#39;ve been here thirty years.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m glad of that. You&#39;re the man I want. Got
a good memory?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pretty good, sir. Not that there&#39;s much to
remember,&quot; and he sighed again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;H&#39;m. Have you any recollection of a murder
which took place at The Laurels twenty-five years
ago?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That I have, sir,&quot; said the waiter, with faint animation,
&quot;it was the talk of the country. Captain
Larcher, wasn&#39;t it, sir, and his wife, a sweetly pretty
woman? She was accused of the murder, I think; but
she didn&#39;t do it. No, nor Mr. Jeringham either,
though some people think he did, &#39;cause he cleared out.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>[pg&nbsp;252]</span>
And small blame to him when they were after him
like roaring lions.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you remember Jeringham?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should think so, sir. Why he stopped in this
very hotel, he did. As kind and affable a gentleman
as I ever met, sir. He kill Captain Larcher? Not he!
no more than did the wife, poor thing! Now I have
my own opinion,&quot; said this wise person significantly,
&quot;but I didn&#39;t take to it for five years after the murder.
As you might say twenty years ago, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who do you think committed the crime, then?&quot;
asked Tait, rather impressed by the man&#39;s manner.</p>

<p class="indent">The waiter looked around, with the enjoyable air of
a man about to impart a piece of startling information,
and bent across the table to communicate it to Tait.
&quot;Denis Bantry was the man, sir,&quot; he said solemnly;
&quot;Captain Larcher&#39;s valet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nonsense! What makes you think that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t think it, sir. I know it. If you don&#39;t
believe me, go to The Laurels and ask the old
gardener, Dick Pental. He saw it,&quot; finished the waiter,
in a tragic whisper.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Saw what? The murder?&quot; said Tait, with a
startled look.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, sir. He saw the murder. I heard it all from
him, I did; I forget the exact story he told me. But
Denis Bantry should have been hanged, sir. Oh, there
isn&#39;t the least doubt about it, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But if this Dick Pental saw the crime committed,
why didn&#39;t he come forward and tell about it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, sir, it was this way,&quot; said Ganymede, dusting
the table with his napkin, &quot;Dick aint all there.
Not to be too delicate, sir, Dick&#39;s mad. He was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page253" id="page253"></a>[pg&nbsp;253]</span>
always a softy from a boy, not that he&#39;s old now, sir.
Forty-five, I believe, and he was twenty years of age
when he was in Captain Larcher&#39;s service.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And is he at The Laurels still?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, yes, sir. You see, after the murder, no one
would take the house. They thought it haunted
maybe, so Dick was put in as caretaker. He looked
after it for twenty years, and then it was taken by
a gentleman who didn&#39;t care for murders or ghosts.
He&#39;s there now, sir, and so is Dick, who still looks
after the garden.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But why didn&#39;t Dick relate what he saw?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because of his softness, sir,&quot; said the waiter
deliberately. &quot;You see Dick had been put into a
lunatic asylum, he had, just before he came of age.
Captain Larcher&mdash;a kind gentleman, sir&mdash;took him out,
and made him gardener at The Laurels, so when Dick
saw the murder done, he was afraid to speak, in case
he should be locked up again. No head, you see, sir.
So he held his tongue, he did, and only told me five
years after the murder. Then it was too late, for all
those who were at The Laurels on that night had
disappeared. You don&#39;t happen to know where Denis
Bantry is, sir, do you? For he ought to hang, sir;
indeed he ought.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tait did not think it wise to take this bloodthirsty
waiter into his confidence, but rewarded him with half
a sovereign for his information, and retired to bed to
think the matter over. He was startled by this new
discovery, which seemed to indicate Denis Bantry,
alias Kerry, as the assassin, and wondered if he had
been wrong all through in suspecting Hilliston. Yet
if Kerry had committed the crime, Tait saw no reason
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page254" id="page254"></a>[pg&nbsp;254]</span>
why Hilliston should protect him, as he was evidently
doing. Assuming that the waiter had spoken correctly,
the only ground on which Tait could explain
Hilliston&#39;s conduct was that Mrs. Larcher was implicated
with the old servant in the murder. If Kerry
were arrested he might confess sufficient to entangle
Mrs. Larcher; and as Hilliston loved the woman, a
fact of which Tait was certain, he would not like to
run so great a risk to her liberty. But this reasoning
was upset by the remembrance that Mrs. Larcher had
already been tried and acquitted of the crime; and as
according to law she could not be tried twice on the
same charge, she was safe in any case. Tait was
bewildered by his own thoughts. The kaleidoscope
had shifted again; the combinations were different,
but the component parts were the same; and argue as
he might there seemed no solution of the mystery.
Mrs. Larcher, Denis Bantry, his sister, Hilliston, and
Mark Jeringham; who had killed the unfortunate husband?
Tait could find no answer to this perplexing
question.</p>

<p class="indent">In the morning he walked to The Laurels, which
he had no difficulty in finding, owing to the explicit
directions of his friend the waiter. It was a pretty,
low-roofed house on a slight rise near the river, and
built somewhat after the fashion of a bungalow. The
gardens sloped to the river bank on one side, and on
the other were sheltered from inland winds by a belt
of sycamore trees; in front a light iron railing divided
them from the road, which ran past the house on its
way to the ferry. The gardens were some three acres
in extent, very pretty and picturesque, showing at
every turn that whatever might be the mental state of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page255" id="page255"></a>[pg&nbsp;255]</span>
Dick Pental, he was thorough master of his business.
Tait came into contact with him in a short space of
time through the medium of the housekeeper.</p>

<p class="indent">This individual was a sour old maid, who informed
him with some acerbity that Mr. Deemer, the present
occupant of The Laurels, was away from home,
and without his permission she could not show him
the house. Perhaps she suspected Tait&#39;s errand, for
she looked suspiciously at him, and resolutely refused
to let him cross the threshold. However, as a concession
she said he could inspect the grounds, which
were well worth seeing; and called Dick Pental to
show him round. As Tait had really no great desire
to see the interior of the house, where he would learn
nothing likely to be of service, and a great desire to
speak alone with the mad gardener, he thankfully
accepted the offer, and was then thrown into the
company of the very man whom he most desired
to see.</p>

<p class="indent">Dick Pental was a slender, bright-eyed man, with
a dreamy-looking face; alert in his movements, and
restless with his hands and feet. He did not seem
unintelligent; but the germs of madness were plainly
discernible, and Tait guessed that only his constant
life in the open air kept him from returning to the
asylum whence he had been taken by Captain Larcher.
With justifiable pride this queer creature showed Tait
over the grounds, but never by word or deed did he
hint at the story which he had told the waiter. Still
hopeful, Tait led the conversation on that direction,
and finally succeeded in touching the spring in the
man&#39;s brain which made him relate the whole matter.
The opportunity occurred when the two men were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id="page256"></a>[pg&nbsp;256]</span>
standing on a slight rise overlooking the river. Here
Tait made a remark concerning the view.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What a peaceful scene,&quot; he said, waving his stick
toward the prospect. &quot;Corn lands, farmhouses, the
square-towered church, and the ferry crossing the
placid river. I can imagine nothing more homely, or
so charged with pleasant memories. Here all is peace
and quiet, no trouble, no danger, no crimes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Dick thoughtfully rubbed the half crown given him
by Tait, and looked dreamily at river and sky and
opposite shore. To his abnormally active brain the
scene looked different to what it did to this stranger;
and he could not forbear alluding to the fact. Moreover,
the gentleman had given him money, and Dick
was greedy, so in the expectation of extracting another
coin, he hinted that he could tell a startling story
about this very place.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aint you fond of murders, sir?&quot; he asked
abruptly, turning his bright eyes on Tait.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I don&#39;t think I am,&quot; replied the other,
delighted to think he had succeeded in rousing the
man&#39;s dormant intelligence. &quot;Why do you ask?
Murder is an ugly word, and can have nothing to do
with so peaceful a scene as this.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s all you know, sir,&quot; said Dick eagerly.
&quot;Why, I could tell you of a murder as I seed myself
in this very spot where we are now&mdash;or only a few
yards from it, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tait glanced at his watch with an affectation of
hurry, and shook his head. &quot;I am afraid I can&#39;t
wait,&quot; he said artfully. &quot;I must return to Horriston
in a few minutes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It won&#39;t take longer nor that to tell. Why, I&#39;ve
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page257" id="page257"></a>[pg&nbsp;257]</span>
told it in ten minutes, I have. It&#39;s freezer to the
blood. A murder at night, too,&quot; added Dick, in an
agony lest Tait should go away, &quot;with a lantern and
a corpse&mdash;just like you read in novels.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hm!&quot; observed Tait skeptically, not yet being
sure of the man. &quot;Is it true?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;True as gospel, sir. I wouldn&#39;t tell a lie, I
wouldn&#39;t. I&#39;ve been brought up Methody, you know,
sir, and scorn a falsehood as a snare of the Old &#39;Un.
You make it worth Dicky&#39;s while, sir, and he&#39;ll give
you goose flesh. Oh, that he will.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very good,&quot; said Tait, throwing himself on the
sward. &quot;I don&#39;t mind hearing the legend of this
place. If it is as good as you say I&#39;ll give you half a
sovereign.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In gold?&quot; asked Dick, with a grasping eagerness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In bright gold. See! here is the half sovereign.
You tell the story and it is yours. Now, then, what is
it all about?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Dick Pental sat down beside Tait, but at some distance
away, and chuckled as he rubbed his hands. He
had a chance of making twelve-and-sixpence that
morning, and was overjoyed at his good fortune.
Resolved to begin with a startling remark, he glanced
down to see that they were alone, and then brought it
out.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I could hang a man, I could,&quot; he said cheerfully.
&quot;I could hang him till he was a deader.&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="chXXXIII" id="chXXXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXXIII.</h2>

<p class="h3">THE STORY OF THE MAD GARDENER.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Having</span> made this startling announcement, Dick
Pental drew back to observe the effect on his hearer.
Humoring the man&#39;s vanity, Tait expressed due surprise,
and requested him to narrate the circumstance
to which he referred.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is about twenty-five years ago, it is,&quot; said Dick,
commencing his tale in a great hurry; &quot;and I was the
gardener here to Captain Larcher. You don&#39;t know
him, sir; it aint to be expected as you should. He
was a grown gentleman before you were, and a kind
&#39;un he was; took me out of the asylum, he did.
They said I was mad, you know, and put me into a
strait waistcoat; but I wasn&#39;t a bit wrong in my head,
sir, not I. Captain Larcher he saw that, so he took me
out and made me his gardener. And aint I done a lot
for the place? just you look round and see.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your work is admirable, Dick.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is that,&quot; replied the man with <i>naïve</i> vanity,
&quot;and you aint the first as has said that, sir. Oh, I&#39;m
fond of the garden, I am; flowers are much nicer company
than human beings, I think. Not so cross with
Dicky, you know, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No doubt,&quot; said Tait, seeing that the creature was
following the wanderings of his poor wits. &quot;But
about this murder you&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>[pg&nbsp;259]</span>
&quot;I didn&#39;t know anything was wrong,&quot; interrupted
the gardener earnestly; &quot;I&#39;d have kept out of the way
if I&#39;d known that; but I came here one night when I
shouldn&#39;t have been here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How was that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hot rum and water,&quot; confessed Dick, with great
simplicity. &quot;I drank it&mdash;too much of it, and it went
to my head. It isn&#39;t a strong head, so I came here to
sleep it clear again. That was about twelve o&#39;clock
as near as I can tell, but, Lord bless you, my head
made no account of time, when the hot rum and water
was in it. I woke up and I was frightened finding myself
in the dark,&mdash;I hate the dark, don&#39;t you, sir?&mdash;so
I finished some rum that I had with me and went
to sleep again. Then I woke up sudden, I did, and I
saw it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The murder being committed?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, not quite that! But I saw a man lying on
the ground just over there, and he didn&#39;t move a bit.
Another man was holding him in his arms, and Denis
Bantry was standing by with a lantern.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who was the other man?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was a gentleman called Mr. Jeringham. Oh,
yes! My head was queer, but I knew him by his
clothes, I did. I was at the grand ball of the gentry,
you know; it was there I got drunk&mdash;and I saw Mr.
Jeringham there in black clothes with gold trimmings.
He had them on when he bent over Captain Larcher.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How did you know the man on the ground was
Captain Larcher?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I didn&#39;t, then,&quot; confessed Dick ingenuously; &quot;but
when I heard as they found him in the river, I knew it
was him, I did. I saw them drop him in!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page260" id="page260"></a>[pg&nbsp;260]</span>
&quot;Denis Bantry and Mr. Jeringham?&quot; exclaimed
Tait, astonished at the minuteness of these details.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. They talked together for a bit, but my head
was so queer that I couldn&#39;t make out what they said.
But they picked up Captain Larcher, one at the head
and the other at the heels, and they dropped him in&mdash;Splash!
he went, he did. I was behind a tree and they
couldn&#39;t see me. Ugh!&quot; said the man, with a shiver,
&quot;how I did feel afraid when he went splash into the
cold water. Then I went away and held my tongue.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why did you do that? It was your duty to have
come forward and told the truth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Dick Pental put on a cunning look, and shook his
head. &quot;Not me, sir,&quot; he said artfully. &quot;They&#39;d have
said my head was queer and put me in an asylum again.
No, no, Dicky was too clever for them, he was.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you say it was Denis Bantry who killed Captain
Larcher,&quot; said Tait, after a moment&#39;s reflection.
&quot;How do you know that, when you did not see the
blow struck? It might have been Mr. Jeringham.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Looking lovingly at the piece of gold which was now
in his possession, Dick shook his head with great vigor.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It wasn&#39;t Mr. Jeringham,&quot; he protested. &quot;He was
a good, kind gentleman. He gave Dicky half a crown
the day before. He was fond of Captain Larcher&#39;s
wife, so he couldn&#39;t have killed Captain Larcher.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Against this insane reasoning Tait had nothing to
urge, as Dicky was evidently convinced that Denis
Bantry was guilty, to the exclusion of Jeringham.
Had the former given him money instead of the latter
he would doubtless have accused Jeringham and sworn
to the innocence of Denis. The man&#39;s brain was too
weak to be depended upon; but Tait recognized that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page261" id="page261"></a>[pg&nbsp;261]</span>
the report he gave of the occurrence of that fatal night
was true and faithful in all respects. Dicky was not
sufficiently imaginative to invent such a story.</p>

<p class="indent">Satisfied from the importance of the knowledge he
had gained that his time had not been wasted, Tait
wished to be alone to think out the matter. There
was some difficulty in getting rid of Dicky, who was
still greedily expectant of further tips, but in the end
he induced the man to return to his work, and set out
for Horriston at a brisk walk. He always thought
better when exercising his limbs, and before he reached
the town he had arrived at several conclusions respecting
the case as seen under the new light thrown on it
by the gardener.</p>

<p class="indent">For one thing, he concluded that Paynton was Jeringham.
The reason for Denis being in his service
had been explained by Dick Pental, as the two men
were bound together by a common bond of guilt.
Tait was inclined to think that Jeringham was innocent,
for if he had killed Larcher there would have
been no need for Denis to have screened him. On the
other hand, circumstantial evidence was so strong
against Jeringham that, if Denis had struck the blow,
he would be forced to acquiesce in the silence of the
real criminal&mdash;to become, as it were, an accessory to
the crime. Denis could have sworn that Jeringham
was guilty, and so placed him in danger of his life.
Thus the two men had a hold on one another; Jeringham
because circumstances were against him, Denis
because he had killed Larcher. The motive for the
crime was not difficult to discover after the story told
by Mrs. Bezel. Bantry had killed his master as the
destroyer of his sister&#39;s honor. Under the names of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page262" id="page262"></a>[pg&nbsp;262]</span>
Paynton and Kerry the two men were dwelling together
at Thorston in loathed companionship, each afraid to
let the other out of his sight. Tait could imagine no
more terrible punishment than that enforced comradeship.
It reminded him of a similar situation in a novel
of Zola&#39;s, where husband and wife were equally culpable,
equally afraid, and filled with equal hatred the
one toward the other.</p>

<p class="indent">Still this conclusion, supported as it was by facts,
did not explain the attitude of Hilliston. Assuming
the guilt of Denis Bantry, the complicity of Jeringham,
there appeared to be no reason why Hilliston
should protect them at Thorston, and throw obstacles
in the way of the truth&#39;s discovery. Tait was completely
nonplussed and could think of no explanation.
And then he remembered Mrs. Bezel&#39;s letter, and the
mention of Louisa Sinclair. Hilliston, according to
Mrs. Bezel, knew this woman, and she knew who had
committed the crime. But how could she know unless
she had been concealed, like Dick Pental, in the garden
on that night? Tait was quite certain that Denis
Bantry was guilty, but the hint of Mrs. Bezel threatened
to disturb this view; and yet what better evidence
was obtainable than that of an eye-witness.
Still Tait remembered that Dicky confessed he had
not seen the blow struck. What if Louisa Sinclair
had? That was the question he asked himself.</p>

<p class="indent">Under the circumstances it was necessary to find
out who this woman was. Tait did not judge it wise
to ask Hilliston, for the simple reason that the lawyer
would not admit the truth. There was no obvious
reason why he should not, but Tait had sufficient experience
of Hilliston&#39;s trickery and evasion in the past
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page263" id="page263"></a>[pg&nbsp;263]</span>
to know that his admissions were untrustworthy.
There only remained for him to search for Louisa
Sinclair in Horriston, question her if she were alive, or
learn all that he could if she were dead.</p>

<p class="indent">And now occurred a coincidence which unwittingly
put Tait on the right track. When within half a mile
of Horriston he met a clergyman swinging along at a
good pace, and in him recognized a former college
companion. The recognition and the delight were
mutual.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear Brandon, this is indeed a surprise!&quot; exclaimed
Tait, holding out his hand. &quot;I had no idea
that you were in these parts.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have only been vicar here for a year,&quot; answered
Brandon cordially; &quot;but what are you doing at Horriston,
my friend?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I have come down partly on business and
partly on pleasure.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then dismiss business for the moment, and come
to luncheon with me. I am just going to my house.
Where are you staying?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;At the Royal Victoria.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A dismal place. You must come frequently to
see us while you stay here, and we will do what we can
to cheer you up. Mrs. Brandon will be delighted to
see you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh! So you are married?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For the last five years. Two children. Well, I
am glad to see you again. Do you stay here long?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A few days only,&quot; replied Tait carelessly; &quot;but it
entirely depends on my business.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Anything important?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes and no. By the way, you may be able to help
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page264" id="page264"></a>[pg&nbsp;264]</span>
me, Brandon. Do you know anyone in this parish
called Miss Louisa Sinclair?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The vicar reflected for a few moments, and shook
his head. &quot;No, I never heard the name. She must
have been here before my time. Have you any reason
for wanting to see her?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Naturally, or I should not have asked,&quot; said Tait,
with faint sarcasm. &quot;However, I must make a
confidant of you, as I wish for your advice and
assistance.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall be delighted to give both,&quot; said his friend
briskly. &quot;But here we are at my house, and there is
my wife in the porch. My dear, this is an old college
friend of mine, Spenser Tait. We must make him
welcome, for the days that have been.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Brandon, a comfortable, rosy-cheeked matron,
with two tiny Brandons clinging to her skirts, heartily
welcomed Tait, and led the way to the dining room.
Here an extra knife and fork were hastily produced for
the guest, and they all sat down to luncheon in the
best of spirits. For the moment Tait banished all
thought of the case from his mind, and laid himself out
to be agreeable to the vicar&#39;s wife. In this he succeeded,
as she subsequently pronounced him to be
a singularly charming man; while he pronounced her
to be one of the most intelligent women it had been
his fortune to meet.</p>

<p class="indent">After luncheon Brandon conducted Tait to his study,
and there, over an excellent cigar, the little man related
the story of the Larcher affair from the time that
Claude became possessed of the papers. Needless to
say the clergyman was much astonished by the recital,
and agreed with Tait that it was difficult to know
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page265" id="page265"></a>[pg&nbsp;265]</span>
which way to turn in the present dilemma. He
thought that Denis was guilty and Jeringham an
accomplice by force of circumstances; but doubted
whether the existence of Louisa Sinclair might not
altogether alter the complexion of the case.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course, the difficulty will be to find Louisa
Sinclair,&quot; he said thoughtfully; &quot;five-and-twenty years
is a long time to go back to. She may be dead.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So she may,&quot; rejoined Tait a trifle tartly; &quot;on the
other hand she may be alive. I found that waiter and
that gardener who were at Horriston then. Both
remember the case, so it is probable that I shall find
this woman, or at least gain sufficient information to
trace her whereabouts.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I cannot recall her name, Tait. She has not been
here in my time. Fortunately I can help you in this
much; that an old parishioner of mine is calling to-day,
and, as she has lived here for the last forty years and
more, it is likely she will remember if such a person
dwelt here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who is this old lady?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear fellow, you must not call her an old lady.
It is true she is over forty, but&mdash;well she is always
young and charming in her own eyes. Miss Belinda
Pike is her name, and I shouldn&#39;t like to come under
the lash of her tongue.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is she such a Tartar?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She is&mdash;&mdash;My dear fellow, you must not ask me to
talk scandal about my parishioners; moreover, I see the
lady in question is coming up the garden path. Once
set her tongue going, and you will learn all the history
of Horriston for the last hundred years.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I only want to go back twenty-five,&quot; rejoined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page266" id="page266"></a>[pg&nbsp;266]</span>
Tait, smiling; and at that moment Miss Belinda Pike
was announced.</p>

<p class="indent">She was a tall, bony female with a hook nose, a false
front, and an artificial smile.  Dressed in voluminous
raiment, she bore down on Brandon like a frigate in
full sail; and proceeded to talk.  All the time she
remained in the study she talked, of herself, of parish
work, of Dorcas meetings, of scandals new and old;
and so astonished Tait by the extent of her petty information
and the volubility of her tongue that he
could only stare and wonder.  Introduced to him she
was graciously pleased to observe that she had heard
of him and his inquiries.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The waiter, you know, Mr. Tait,&quot; she said, smiling
at his astonishment.  &quot;Sugden is his name; he
told me all about you.  Now, why do you wish to learn
all about that Larcher crime?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For amusement merely,&quot; replied Tait, rather
scandalizing the vicar by this answer.  &quot;The waiter
began to speak of it, and I encouraged him; later on I
heard the story from a gardener.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;From Dicky Pental,&quot; interrupted Miss Pike
vivaciously.  &quot;Oh, he can tell you nothing&mdash;he is
mad!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mad or not, he told me a great deal.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All false, no doubt.  My dear Mr. Tait,&quot; continued
the lady impressively, &quot;only one person can
tell you the truth of that case.  Myself!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Or Louisa Sinclair.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Louisa Sinclair!  What do you know about her?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing, save her name,&quot; replied Tait; &quot;but I
want to know more.  Can you give me the required
information?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page267" id="page267"></a>[pg&nbsp;267]</span>
&quot;Yes. Come and have afternoon tea with me to-day,
and I&#39;ll tell you all.  Oh, yes,&quot; said Miss Pike,
with a self-satisfied nod, &quot;I know who killed Captain
Larcher.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jeringham&mdash;Denis, the valet&mdash;Hilliston?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No.  Those three people are innocent.  I can
swear to it.  I know it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then who is guilty?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why,&quot; said Miss Pike quietly, &quot;Mrs. Larcher&#39;s
maid&mdash;Mona Bantry.&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="chXXXIV" id="chXXXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXXIV.</h2>

<p class="h3">A LETTER FROM HORRISTON.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">&quot;My Dear Claude</span>:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In my last letter I informed you of my various discoveries
with regard to the case.  I deem myself singularly
fortunate in finding those who could afford me the
necessary information.  Five-and-twenty years is a
wide gap of time, and, to tell the honest truth, I scarcely
expected to be successful in my mission.  Death,
absence, old age, might have put an end to all who
knew about the case, but, as you are already advised, I
unexpectedly met with three people who gave me three
different versions of the murder from their various
points of view.  First, the waiter Sugden, who merely
reflected the opinion of Dick Pental; second, the
gardener himself, with his first-hand story; and third,
Miss Belinda Pike, whose ideas are quite at variance
with the other two.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I mentioned to you that I had met Miss Pike at
my friend Brandon&#39;s, and that she had invited me to
visit her the next day to hear her story of the case.
Of course, I went, and found the lady an excellent
character for my purpose.  She has a truly wonderful
memory for the small beer of life.  She is a born gossip,
and is one of the most spiteful women it has ever been
my fortune to meet.  Her invitation was more to satisfy
her own vanity and curiosity than because she wished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page269" id="page269"></a>[pg&nbsp;269]</span>
to do me a service; but if she is gratified in the one
she is balked in the other.  With some difficulty&mdash;for
she is a most persistent creature&mdash;I managed to evade
her inquiries as to my reason for wishing to know
about &#39;The Larcher Affair&#39;; and extracted from her
all information likely to be of service to us in discovering
the truth.  What she told me leaves me more in
the dark than ever; and I shall doubtless return to
Thorston no whit nearer the truth than I was when I
set out.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But before narrating her story, as imparted to me
in strict secrecy, you must not be offended if certain
reflections are cast by this busybody on your mother.
To get at the truth of this complication you must view
it from a disinterested standpoint and throw aside all
prejudice.  I do not for a moment believe that Mrs.
Larcher intended to willfully deceive her husband, as
is implied by Miss Pike, but I must confess I think her
conduct was highly reprehensible.  Still I pass no
judgment, as it is not my place to do so; and you
must clearly understand that the remarks herein contained
about her are those of Miss Pike.  You can
guess from their tenor what a very spiteful old lady
she is.  I promised to report my doings and hearings
faithfully to you, and I hereby keep my promise, and
at the cost of your losing your temper.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The cause of Miss Pike&#39;s malignity is jealousy&mdash;a
passion which is as active now with her as it was
twenty-five years ago.  Then the fair Belinda, according
to her own account, was the belle of Horriston,
and shared that enviable position with two rivals&mdash;the
one being your mother, the other Miss Louisa Sinclair.
I fancy I hear you exclaim at the mention of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page270" id="page270"></a>[pg&nbsp;270]</span>
name. But Mrs. Bezel is right; such a person does
exist. She was a passably pretty girl,&mdash;according to
Miss Pike,&mdash;and rather popular,&mdash;again Miss Pike,&mdash;but
cared for no one so much as Mr. Francis Hilliston,
then a handsome young lawyer of great promise and
good family. This is evidently the romance of Hilliston&#39;s
life, and accounts for his silence about Louisa
Sinclair. He did not wish to speak of one who had
disappeared under somewhat discreditable circumstances;
yet who truly loved him. Whether he
returned her love I cannot say. Suspend your
judgment till you hear the story of this maiden lady.
Of course, it is quite different to that of Dick Pental,
and, I think, less easy to believe. The gardener spoke
of what he saw; Miss Pike speaks of what she thinks.
Judge for yourself which is right.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As I have said, Miss Pike was a belle in her
younger days. She was also well off, and could have
made a good match. Unfortunately, she was in love
with Hilliston; I say unfortunately, because he happened
to be in love with Mrs. Larcher. I again apologize
for putting the matter so plainly, but Miss Pike
insisted that it was so. In those days Hilliston must
have been a handsome and fascinating man, for Louisa
Sinclair also loved him&mdash;with a like result. He had
no eyes for these two damsels, but quietly devoted
himself to Mrs. Larcher. I do not mean to say that
he roused the suspicions of your father, for his devotion
was perfectly respectful. The desire of the moth
for the star, I may say&mdash;for Hilliston knew well enough
that he had no chances in that quarter for two reasons.
First, Mrs. Larcher was a married woman; second,
she was in love with Jeringham.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page271" id="page271"></a>[pg&nbsp;271]</span>
&quot;At the time of that notable dress ball matters
stood thus:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Miss Belinda Pike in love with Hilliston.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Miss Louisa Sinclair in love with Hilliston.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hilliston in love with Mrs. Larcher.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mrs. Larcher in love with Jeringham.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can you imagine anything more complicated; and
to make confusion still worse, Miss Pike solemnly
asserted that Jeringham was not in love with Mrs.
Larcher, but with her maid, Mona Bantry. Therefore,
all round, each of these five people was in love
with the wrong person. It was a modern &#39;Comedy of
Errors,&#39; with a tragic ending.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Miss Pike went to the ball in the character of a
flower girl, and there was astonished to find two Mary,
Queen of Scots, and two Darnleys. During the night
she learned that out of jealousy Louisa Sinclair had
adopted the same fancy dress as your mother. She
was the second Queen of Scots, and was attired precisely
the same in all respects, save that Mrs. Larcher
wore a small dagger, and Miss Sinclair did not. On
making this discovery Miss Pike naturally thought&mdash;as
a jealous woman would&mdash;that the second Darnley was
Hilliston. She knew that the first was Jeringham, and
did not trouble herself about him, but maneuvered to
get speech with the second. To her astonishment she
found out&mdash;how I cannot say&mdash;that it was Captain
Larcher, who was supposed to be in London. He confessed
that he was jealous of his wife, and had returned
in disguise to learn the truth. Miss Pike was not clear
whether he was suspicious of Jeringham or of Hilliston,
and she had no opportunity of learning the truth
as Larcher, seeing his wife leave the ballroom, followed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page272" id="page272"></a>[pg&nbsp;272]</span>
her at once. The next day Miss Pike was
informed of the disappearance of Jeringham, and later
on she learned of the death of Captain Larcher.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, you will ask whom she suspected. A woman
with so unhappy a temper would not be long in forming
an opinion about a matter connected with a lady
of whom she was jealous. I allude to your mother.
Miss Pike had a theory, and ever since, declining to
accept the evidence given at the trial, has held firmly
to it. She suspected Mona Bantry to be guilty. I
give her reason in her own words.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Of course it is only theory,&#39; she said, when I
asked her pointblank who she thought was guilty,
&#39;but my suspicions point to Mrs. Larcher&#39;s maid.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;To Mona Bantry?&#39; I asked, rather astonished.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Yes! She was in love with Mr. Jeringham, and
he was at the ball dressed as Darnley; Captain Larcher
wore the same dress. As I told you he left the
ballroom when he saw his wife go out with Mr.
Jeringham. I fancy he followed them home, and
caught them as they parted in the garden of The
Laurels. Very likely he ordered Mr. Jeringham off
the premises, and insisted on his wife going into the
house. Mona, who was sitting up for her mistress,
would open the door, and seeing by the dress, as she
thought, Mr. Jeringham with Mrs. Larcher, I believe
she lost her head and killed him.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Killed him; but how?&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;With the dagger worn by Mrs. Larcher,&#39; responded
Miss Pike triumphantly. &#39;She snatched it from the
sheath as it hung at the girdle of Mrs. Larcher, and
killed the poor man&mdash;thinking he was her lover. Then,
finding out her mistake, she fled.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page273" id="page273"></a>[pg&nbsp;273]</span>
&quot;&#39;But so did Jeringham,&#39; I said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Yes. He also saw the murder, and naturally
enough thought he might be suspected. I think he
took Mona away with him on the very night, and they
fled together. As to the body, Denis, the brother, to
save his sister and possibly his mistress from being suspected,
threw it into the river. That is my theory,
Mr. Tait, and I believe it to be the true one.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I need not repeat more of our conversation, as it
was merely argument on both sides, but you now know
sufficient to see in what direction Miss Pike&#39;s suspicions
are directed. Her story is quite at variance with
that of your mother, who plainly stated that she found
Mona in the sitting room with your father. It is not
strange that the two narrations should be contradictory,
for we must remember that Mrs. Larcher
spoke from facts while Miss Pike only speaks from
hearsay.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Again, from the statement of Dick Pental, it would
appear that the murder took place in the garden; your
mother says it was committed in the sitting room, so
here is another contradiction. But you must not forget
that only one person has sworn to the identity of
those he saw with the body. Miss Pike can prove
nothing from facts, and only evolves accusations out
of her own malignant nature. Your mother accuses
no one, alleging that she fainted in the sitting room.
Therefore, taking all facts into consideration, I believe
the gardener&#39;s story to be true, and that Denis Bantry
killed your father; Jeringham, through force of circumstances,
being an accessory to the deed. This
view accounts for the identity of Paynton with Jeringham,
of Kerry with Denis&mdash;and fully accounts for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page274" id="page274"></a>[pg&nbsp;274]</span>
their living in seclusion at Thorston. This is my
opinion. Do you think you can give a better?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Regarding your mother&#39;s hint about Louisa Sinclair,
I confess I cannot understand it. Miss Pike
was perfectly frank about that person; and stated
that shortly after the murder she went to America
and had not been heard of for years. Hilliston may
know of her whereabouts, but under the circumstances
I do not think he is likely to speak. At all events we
are certain of two things: that Louisa Sinclair did not
marry Hilliston; that she had nothing to do with the
tragedy at The Laurels. Miss Pike intends to show
me a portrait of the lady on the occasion of my next
visit. A knowledge of her looks may lead to something;
but honestly speaking I do not see how she can
possibly be implicated in the matter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I must bring this long letter to a close. I have
found out sufficient at Horriston to justify our suspicions
of the <i>ménage</i> at Rose Cottage, and when I
return we must set our wits to work to see Paynton
and Kerry. They must be forced into plain speaking,
then we may solve the mystery of your father&#39;s death&mdash;not
before. Expect me in two days, and think over
what I have written so that we may discuss the matter
thoroughly when we come together. And so no more
at present from your friend,</p>

<p class="h3">THE ORIGINAL OF THE PORTRAIT.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Claude Larcher</span> was blessed with the best of tempers,
and strongly gifted with self-control. He found
these virtues very necessary in his profession, especially
when in command of a body of men in the wilds.
There no trouble ruffled him, no disappointment depressed
his spirits; he was always serene and amiable,
so that among his comrades his good temper had become
proverbial. Had they seen him at this moment
they would have found reason to alter their opinion.</p>

<p class="indent">The case wore out his patience; he saw no end to
the complications arising therefrom. No sooner was
one obstacle surmounted than another blocked up the
path. But for Tait he would have taken Hilliston&#39;s
advice long ago, and let the matter lie; but the little
man was bent on solving this particularly tantalizing
mystery, and so urged his friend to persevere in what
seemed to be futile attempts. So far Claude had held
to his resolve, but this last letter of Tait&#39;s with its
budget of new complications threw him into a rage.
He vowed that he would throw up the matter as soon
as Tait returned. His father was dead, and there was
an end of it; after five-and-twenty years nothing whatever
could be discovered; and above all there was
Jenny.</p>

<p class="indent">Claude was too clear-sighted to disguise from himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page276" id="page276"></a>[pg&nbsp;276]</span>
the fact that he was in love; and now enlightened
by Mrs. Hilliston regarding the feelings of the young
lady, he was doubly anxious to make her his wife.
Before he could do so he had to remove an obstacle in
the shape of her father, and that was no easy matter.
Who Mr. Paynton was he did not know; whether he
was implicated in the Larcher affair he could not
guess; but of one thing he was certain: that Mr.
Paynton resented his prosecution of the case. While
he continued to investigate the mystery the recluse
would continue inimical, and would therefore refuse
to permit him to pay attentions to his daughter.</p>

<p class="indent">Regarding Linton and his love, Claude had no fears.
He had been assured by Mrs. Hilliston that Jenny
liked him best, and taking advantage of the hint he
had thrown himself as frequently as possible into the
society of his beloved. Did Jenny go to the vicarage,
Claude was there under the pretense of questioning
the clergyman concerning the architecture of the
church; did she practice on the organ, Claude was
always waiting at the door to carry her music-book to
Rose Cottage. A walk in the morning, he was in the
vicinity; a stroll in the evening, and he appeared unexpectedly
round the nearest corner. In driving, riding,
walking, visiting, this persistent young man was
constantly to be found near Miss Jenny Paynton. All
this meant infatuation.</p>

<p class="indent">Availing himself of the opportunities thus afforded,
he learned her secret, and betrayed his own. Without
a word being said on either side&mdash;with the shadow of
the case between them&mdash;these two young people fell in
love with one another. When Tait returned two days
after his last letter, he was confronted by Claude with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page277" id="page277"></a>[pg&nbsp;277]</span>
the intimation that he wished to stop further investigations.
Tait, who was devoured by an unappeasable
curiosity to find out the truth, resented this backsliding,
and told Claude his opinion very plainly. But for
their long friendship they would have quarreled over
the matter; as it was Tait argued out the question,
and induced Claude to come round to his way of
thinking. But it was a hard task.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are not going to turn back after putting
your hand to the plow?&quot; he said, when Claude first
broached the subject of abandoning the case.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why not, if the plow won&#39;t move?&quot; returned the
young man flippantly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The plow will move,&quot; returned Tait vehemently.
&quot;You got my last letter?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I did. But I don&#39;t see that it contains anything
likely to elucidate the mystery. Your Dick Pental is
a madman; your Miss Pike an untrustworthy gossip.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is your opinion, not mine. I have made a
discovery since writing my last letter, of which I have
not yet had time to inform you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll tell you later on. Meanwhile is it on account
of this girl that you have decided to abandon the
case?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Partly, and partly because I think we are wasting
time. Our investigation can lead to no result.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We may find out who killed your father.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I doubt that,&quot; replied Larcher coolly. &quot;You
suspect Hilliston; you suspect Jeringham; you suspect
Mona Bantry. Why, in your last letter you hinted
at the guilt of Denis, simply because a drunken lunatic
told you a wild story; yet, so far as I can see, you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page278" id="page278"></a>[pg&nbsp;278]</span>
have not a morsel of evidence against any one of the
four.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are wrong,&quot; said Tait, in an argumentative
manner. &quot;The misfortune is that there is too much
evidence against them all. I could furnish you with a
case against each which&mdash;so far as circumstantial evidence
is concerned&mdash;would convince you of their
individual guilt.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Theory, Tait, theory!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We&#39;ll prove that soon, my boy,&quot; said Tait, with
exasperating coolness, &quot;if you back out of the case,
I at least am determined to see it through. I suppose
you are bent on marrying the young lady.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If she&#39;ll have me&mdash;yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Humph! There&#39;s another obstacle which you have
overlooked. The consent of her father&mdash;our mysterious
friend, Paynton.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have not overlooked the obstacle. I will obtain
his consent from his own lips.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And how do you intend to see him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Through the agency of Mr. Hilliston,&quot; replied
Larcher calmly. &quot;He has agreed to introduce me to
Paynton to-morrow. Here is his letter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The little man fairly bounded from his chair, and
he took the letter from his friend&#39;s hand with an air
of bewilderment. After mastering the contents he
returned it with a satisfied nod.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I congratulate you, Claude,&quot; he said, with a good-humored
air. &quot;Though you failed with the man, you
may succeed with the matter. But how in the name
of Olympian Jove did you induce Hilliston to do this?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, he saw that I was in love with Jenny, and
for some inexplicable reason has agreed to forward my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page279" id="page279"></a>[pg&nbsp;279]</span>
suit, by introducing me to plead my cause with the
father.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not so inexplicable as you think,&quot; said Tait
sagaciously. &quot;I see his idea. He thinks you will be
so occupied with love-making as to abandon the case.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know that he isn&#39;t right.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I see you are bent on getting quit of the
matter, Claude. But,&quot; and Tait shook a reproving
forefinger, &quot;you will change your mind after this
interview with our hermit friend.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why so?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You will learn something which will astonish you.
I only wish I could be present with you to see what
occurs.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But if I make no reference to the case,&quot; said
Larcher seriously.</p>

<p class="indent">Tait waxed indignant on the instant, and spoke his
mind freely. &quot;Claude, my friend, I went into this
matter solely on your account, and you owe it to me
to see it through. If you find further investigation a
bar to your marriage I will agree to let the matter
drop. But first,&quot; added Tait, with emphasis, &quot;you
must make an effort to get the truth out of this man.
Swear to him that you are resolved to push the matter
to the end. Tell him that I have learned something
new at Horriston. Mention the name of Louisa Sinclair.
Then see the result. After hearing the story
of Dicky Pental I am convinced that this man is
Jeringham.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will do all you say,&quot; replied Claude, after some
hesitation, &quot;but I am afraid that my pertinacity in
this matter will prejudice my wooing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If, at the end of the interview, you see that, withdraw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page280" id="page280"></a>[pg&nbsp;280]</span>
your intention to go on with the case. Then out
of gratitude he may give you his daughter. Bluff him
first&mdash;yield afterward. In that way we may discover
who Paynton is&mdash;what he has to do with the case,
and why he is connected with Hilliston. Do you
agree? Good! Give me your hand on that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The two men shook hands, though it was not without
a secret qualm that Claude thus sealed the compact.
After a pause he said:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And who is this Louisa Sinclair you make such a
point of my mentioning to Paynton?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah! That is my discovery,&quot; said Tait, rubbing his
hands. &quot;When I interviewed Mrs. Bezel I showed
her a portrait of Mrs. Hilliston, whom curiously
enough she had never seen&mdash;no doubt Hilliston has
his reasons therefor. She seemed startled, but said
nothing. Then she wrote to you about Louisa
Sinclair.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But what has Louisa Sinclair to do with Mrs.
Hilliston?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can&#39;t you guess? Miss Pike showed me a portrait
of Louisa Sinclair taken twenty-five years ago. I did
not then wonder at Mrs. Bezel&#39;s start, or that Hilliston
had refrained from letting her see the picture of
his wife. In a word, Louisa Sinclair and Mrs. Hilliston
are one and the same woman.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah!&quot; cried Claude, with a sudden recollection,
&quot;it was for that she was so afraid of your going to
Horriston.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. She thought I might learn too much. This
is the beginning of the end, Claude.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What! Do you think Mrs. Hilliston knows anything
of the case?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page281" id="page281"></a>[pg&nbsp;281]</span>
&quot;According to your mother she knows a good deal.
According to Miss Pike she is in possession of certain
facts. Yes, I think Mrs. Hilliston can help us if she
will.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But, my dear Tait,&quot; said Claude quietly, &quot;Mrs.
Hilliston is an American.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah! Louisa Sinclair went to America, and probably
became a naturalized subject of the Stars and
Stripes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But,&quot; objected Larcher, &quot;she was a widow when
she married Hilliston.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So I believe. A Mrs. Derrick. No doubt she
came by all her money through that first marriage.
Oh, I can put the puzzle easily together. No wonder
Hilliston wanted the case dropped, both on his own
account and on that of his wife.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you mean, Tait? Do you suspect
that&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Say no more,&quot; said Tait, rising, &quot;I will tell you
what I mean after you have seen Paynton. But
then,&quot; added he significantly, &quot;I don&#39;t think you
will need any explanation.&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="chXXXVI" id="chXXXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXXVI.</h2>

<p class="h3">A STRANGE THING HAPPENS.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> next morning Claude received a second letter
from Hilliston, stating that as his wife was ill he
would be unable to come over to Thorston, but directing
the young man to go to Rose Cottage at noon,
when Mr. Paynton would be ready to receive him.
Tait regretted that he had not been included in the
invitation, and carefully instructed Claude how to act
during the interview.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I believe Paynton can settle the matter,&quot; were his
parting words, &quot;so put love out of your head for the
time being, and do your best to extract the truth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Anxious to oblige one who took so much interest in
his private affairs, Larcher promised to do what he
could, and shortly after eleven started for Rose Cottage.
As a matter of fact, he need not have gone so
soon, but he did so in the hope of meeting with Jenny.
Well acquainted as he was with her movements, his
surmise proved correct, for he met the young lady
at the end of Nightingale Lane. She blushed, and
expressed surprise at the meeting. But such feigning
is part of love&#39;s comedy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I did not expect to see you here, Mr. Larcher,&quot;
she said, after the first greetings had passed between
them. &quot;Where are you going?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am about to call on your father.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page283" id="page283"></a>[pg&nbsp;283]</span>
&quot;Really!&quot; said Jenny, with some perplexity and
more doubt. &quot;I am afraid you go on a useless errand.
My father sees no one.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He will see me,&quot; replied Claude quietly. &quot;I
come by appointment. Mr. Hilliston spoke to your
father, with the result that he has agreed to see me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Has your visit anything to do with&mdash;with that
novel?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It has everything to do with it. I wish to ask Mr.
Paynton some questions in connection with my father&#39;s
death.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But he knows nothing&mdash;nothing!&quot; cried Jenny
vehemently; &quot;he can tell you nothing! It is worse
than useless for you to speak to him on the subject.
You will only make him ill.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I have to speak to him on another subject,&quot;
said Claude artfully.</p>

<p class="indent">Jenny looked up inquiringly, remarked the passion
in his gaze, and turned away her face with a blush.
Much as she would have liked to, she found it impossible
to appear ignorant of his meaning.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It seems to me that I am the person to be first
consulted,&quot; she said, with a pout.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jenny, I&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hush! Here is Kerry. See my father first, and
then see me. Till then good-by.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She flitted rapidly away, and turned the corner of
the lane as Kerry, more crabbed-looking than ever,
came up to where Claude was standing. It was then
that Larcher saw that the old servant was suffering
under some strong emotion. His eyes were brighter
than usual, his lips quivered, and he was so nervous
that he could keep neither limbs nor body at rest.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page284" id="page284"></a>[pg&nbsp;284]</span>
Rightly connecting this agitation with his visit, Claude
wisely held his peace, and waited to hear what Kerry
had to say.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;ll be after seeing the master, sir,&quot; said Kerry,
in breathless anxiety. &quot;He is waiting for you, sir, in
the garden.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was just on my way there, Kerry, and stopped to
speak for a few minutes to Miss Jenny. I am very
glad that Mr. Paynton has consented to see me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you may well be glad, Master Claude.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Master Claude!&quot; echoed the young man, stopping
short.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, blazes! &#39;twas a slip of the tongue, sir,&quot; cried
Kerry anxiously. &quot;Don&#39;t notice it, sir. Sure, it&#39;s
old I am, and my mind wanders.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then you deny that you are Denis Bantry?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Say nothing of that, sir. Let the master speak his
own mind to you. You&#39;ll know soon enough who I
am, and that&#39;s a fact, anyhow.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am convinced in my own mind that you are my
father&#39;s old servant,&quot; said Larcher, as he resumed his
walk, &quot;but who your master is I am not so clear.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Kerry shook his head, and pursed up his lips, as
though determined to let no information escape him.
They walked along in silence, and it was only when he
unlocked the gate in the red brick wall that Kerry
again opened his mouth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Keep silent, sir, if you love me,&quot; he said, in a low
tone. &quot;Don&#39;t agitate the master. He&#39;ll do the speaking,
and tell ye all ye wish to know. Begad, and more
too.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Larcher nodded, and passed into the garden. The
morning was warm and sunny, and the colors of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page285" id="page285"></a>[pg&nbsp;285]</span>
flowers were dazzling in the warm glow, against the
white walls of the cottage. With his hands clasped
behind his back, Paynton paced meditatively up and
down the path before the house, but stopped as he
caught sight of his visitor. Taking off his hat in
tribute to the venerable looks of the old gentleman,
Claude bowed, and waited to be addressed. For some
moments Paynton looked at him in silence, with much
emotion, then controlling himself with some difficulty
held out his hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am glad to see you, Mr.&mdash;Mr.&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Larcher,&quot; suggested Claude, seeing his host at a
loss for the name.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Larcher!&quot; gasped Paynton, with an effort, &quot;yes&mdash;yes!
My friend, Mr. Hilliston, advised me of your
coming. Let us enter the house. We will have more
privacy there.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">As Claude knew no one was about in that walled
place but Kerry and the deaf old housekeeper, he
wondered what further privacy was necessary; but
considering that Paynton had doubtless good reason
for his action, he bowed silently and followed him
within, as requested.</p>

<p class="indent">In a few minutes they were in the bookroom.
Paynton seated himself in such a position as to place
his back to the strong light shining through the window,
and asked Claude to be seated in a chair which
lacked this advantage. In this way Paynton could
observe every change in the face of his visitor, while
his own, being in the shadow, was more difficult
to read. Larcher saw the maneuver, but did not
think it necessary to make any objection. In his
place Tait would have acted differently.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page286" id="page286"></a>[pg&nbsp;286]</span>
&quot;I am greatly obliged that you have consented to
see me,&quot; said Claude, breaking the silence, &quot;for I am
informed that you live a very secluded life.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is true. I accord you this interview at the
request of my friend, Mr. Hilliston, but at the same
time I may tell you that I have my own reasons for
granting it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think I can guess your reasons, Mr. Paynton.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No doubt,&quot; replied Paynton, touching a book on
the table; &quot;they are not unconnected with this novel.
You know, of course, that my daughter&mdash;that Jenny
supplied young Linton with the material for his
plot.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do. She found the report of my father&#39;s murder
in some old newspapers in this house.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did you not think it strange that I should be in
possession of such a report?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Naturally I did,&quot; answered Claude, replying to
this direct question with marked embarrassment, &quot;and
it is on that account that I ask you to help me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you think I can do so?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am sure of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why?&quot; asked Paynton, in an unsteady voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because you know about the matter. You retained
the report of the trial. Denis Bantry is in your service
under the name of Kerry, and&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How do you know that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, in the third volume of that book there is an
episode of a scarfpin which is not mentioned in the report
of the trial, but which was told to Miss Paynton by
the man you call Kerry. Now, only two persons knew
that a scarfpin was picked up in the grounds of The
Laurels after the murder. One was Hilliston, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page287" id="page287"></a>[pg&nbsp;287]</span>
other Denis Bantry. You must see, Mr. Paynton,
that I can only come to one conclusion.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I presume you got this information from Hilliston,&quot;
said Paynton, in an altered voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Hilliston spoke of it,&quot; replied Claude cautiously.</p>

<p class="indent">He did not intend to reveal that he had heard it
from his mother, or indeed to reveal the existence of
Mrs. Larcher until he was sure of his ground, and
positive of Paynton&#39;s identity. Accepting his diplomatic
answer in the affirmative, Paynton nodded, and
went on with his questioning.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You spoke to Kerry on the subject?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I did. But, as you may guess, I failed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Naturally. Kerry is a faithful servant. I owe
more to him than I can ever repay. But here we are
talking about the murder,&quot; added Paynton irrelevantly,
&quot;when you wish to speak about Jenny, at least
so Hilliston informed me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do wish to speak of your daughter later on,&quot;
said Claude, with a flushed cheek; &quot;but in the meantime
I am anxious to come to an understanding about
this crime.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why?&quot; said Paynton, rather disconcerted at his
failure to turn the conversation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because I have sworn to avenge the death of my
father.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is what a good son should do,&quot; said Paynton
thoughtfully. &quot;But after twenty-five years the
chances are small. You wish to find the murderer&mdash;so
do I.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. I am more deeply interested in this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page288" id="page288"></a>[pg&nbsp;288]</span>
matter than you suppose. Who do you think I am?&quot;
he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I cannot say, unless you are Jeringham.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jeringham?&quot; said Paynton in a faltering tone.
&quot;No, I am not Jeringham, poor soul! Do you think
him guilty of the crime?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do and I don&#39;t. Sometimes it seems so, at
others I fancy Hilliston to be guilty.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hilliston guilty!&quot; said Paynton, rising. &quot;What
do you mean?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, it is only a theory,&quot; said Claude hastily.
&quot;But my friend Tait, who was at Horriston a few
days ago, found out all kinds of things which implicated
one person and another. He found&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t tell me&mdash;don&#39;t tell me,&quot; said Paynton hastily.
&quot;I cannot talk to you longer or else I shall be ill.
This interview has already tried me too much. Here,&quot;
he added, unlocking a drawer in his desk, &quot;take these
papers. You will find in them a full account of all I
know of the matter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You were, then, an eye-witness?&quot; said Claude,
joyfully slipping the roll of manuscript into his
pocket. He had been more successful than he had
hoped to be.</p>

<p class="indent">Paynton pressed his hands together, and looked
eagerly at Claude. &quot;I can bear it no longer,&quot; he said
impatiently, laying his hands on the shoulders of the
astonished young man. &quot;Boy&mdash;boy, can you not
guess who I am?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; replied Larcher, rising to his feet in some
wonder, &quot;I do not know who you can be, unless you
are Jeringham.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am not Jeringham. He is dead.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page289" id="page289"></a>[pg&nbsp;289]</span>
&quot;Dead!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aye, murdered. Can you not see&mdash;can you not
guess? Claude, the man who was killed at Horriston
was not George Larcher, it was Mark Jeringham!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am your father!&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="chXXXVII" id="chXXXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXXVII.</h2>

<p class="h3">A VOICE FROM THE GRAVE.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was close on two o&#39;clock, and, weary of waiting
for Claude, the master of the Manor House had seated
himself at the luncheon table. He was curious to
know what had taken place between his friend and Mr.
Paynton, as he judged from the length of time the
interview had lasted that some important communication
must have been made. Had Claude discovered
the identity of Paynton with Jeringham? If so, had
Jeringham confessed to the crime? These questions
so annoyed and perplexed Tait that he could not
swallow a mouthful of food. Throwing aside his napkin
he rose from the table to see if Larcher had
returned.</p>

<p class="indent">As he pushed back his chair the door opened and
Claude, with a roll of papers in his hand, made his
appearance. Tait turned to greet him with a smile,
but it disappeared from his face and the words died
on his lips when he saw the white and haggard countenance
of his friend.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good Heavens, man!&quot; he cried, hastening toward
him; &quot;what is the matter? Here, sit down! Drink
this glass of wine!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Claude did as he was bidden; then waved his hand
in the direction of Dormer, who, stolid as ever, stood
waiting orders.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page291" id="page291"></a>[pg&nbsp;291]</span>
&quot;You can go, Dormer,&quot; said Tait hastily. Then,
when the man leaving the room closed the door after
him, and they found themselves alone, he continued:
&quot;Is anything wrong, Claude? Did Paynton tell&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not Paynton,&quot; said Larcher, finishing his wine
and setting down the glass; &quot;there is not such a
person!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aha!&quot; remarked Tait, rubbing his hands. &quot;I
thought the name was a feigned one. And who is our
friend, Mr. Paynton?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My father!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tait opened his mouth to utter an ejaculation, shut
it without doing so, and looked dumfounded at his
friend.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What&mdash;what&mdash;what do you mean? Are you
mad?&quot; he stammered, sitting down limply.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I am not mad,&quot; groaned Claude, &quot;though I
have suffered enough to make me so. I mean what I
say. It was Jeringham who was murdered. Jeringham,
who was dressed as Darnley on that night, as was
my father. Jeringham, whose corpse was so unrecognizable
by decomposition that it was thought to be
that of George Larcher. My father is alive! My
father is hiding here as Ferdinand Paynton. This is
his story of the tragedy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He placed the roll of paper in Tait&#39;s hands, and
poured himself out another glass of wine. Overcome
with amazement the little man looked first at the
paper, then at his friend. It was some minutes before
he could collect his wits together and speak
coherently.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What an extraordinary thing,&quot; he said at length.
&quot;You thought both your parents dead, but now it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page292" id="page292"></a>[pg&nbsp;292]</span>
seems they are alive. Your mother at Clarence Cottage,
Hampstead; your father at Rose Cottage,
Thorston. Did you tell your father that Mrs. Larcher
was still in existence?&quot; he asked sharply.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I had no time to do so,&quot; said Claude, with an
effort. &quot;My father placed those papers in my hand,
and then confessed who he was. I wished to speak
further to him, but he pushed me out of the room,
saying, &#39;Read that confession, and form your judgment
before you accept me as your father.&#39; I hardly
knew what I was doing till I found myself in the lane
outside. Then I came on here. I still feel quite
bewildered.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t wonder at it! Take another glass of wine.
Did your&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t ask any questions, Tait,&quot; said Claude, rising
impatiently. &quot;Read me the confession at once. I
can&#39;t do it myself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Won&#39;t you have some luncheon?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No! Every mouthful would choke me. I&#39;ll lie
down on the sofa, and you bring your chair close to me
to read.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tait nodded, and unrolled the papers, while Claude,
filling himself another glass of claret, crossed over to
the sofa and lay down thereon. With the glass of
wine on the carpet beside him; with the untasted
luncheon on the table, he closed his eyes with a weary
sigh, and compelled himself to listen. Tait glanced
sympathetically at him, then without remark, though
he was burning to speak, smoothed out the paper and
began to read slowly. The writing was clear and legible,
the matter interesting, so there was no difficulty
in deciphering the story of the tragedy, as narrated by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page293" id="page293"></a>[pg&nbsp;293]</span>
the man, who, for twenty-two years, had been supposed
to be the victim. The confession (so-called) was in
the form of a letter from father to son:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;<span class="smcap">Dear Claude</span>:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;At length I have made up my mind to reveal
myself to you, and to set out at length the circumstances
which placed me in this position. I am
led to do so by three things. Firstly, your presence
in this neighborhood with the avowed intention of
avenging my death. Secondly, the publication of the
novel entitled &#39;A Whim of Fate,&#39; which sets out the
particulars of what happened at Horriston in 1866,
more or less perverted for fictional purposes. Thirdly,
the advice of Francis Hilliston, an old and valued
friend, who points out that the only way to stop you in
the investigation is to admit my identity, and so do
away with your motive, viz., the avenging of my death.
On reading this I leave it to yourself whether you will
still consider me your father, and visit me accordingly,
or whether you will look on me as a guilty man. Till
you are acquainted with the truth, so far as I am aware
of it, I swear that I will not approach you or open my
mouth in your presence. On this understanding I set
forth the following facts as shortly as is consistent with
clearness. Judge me as you please, but I declare
before God that I am innocent of Jeringham&#39;s death,
and that I know not who killed him. This for the
prologue; and now for the story.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You will understand that I wish to cast no aspersions
on the memory of your mother; but in the
present case, it is necessary that I should speak plainly.
Your mother and I were ill suited to one another, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page294" id="page294"></a>[pg&nbsp;294]</span>
lived unhappily together. Even when in the army I
was addicted to literary pursuits, and, when I sent in
my papers, I devoted myself almost entirely to study.
Your mother was gay and social. Being a beautiful
woman she liked admiration, and was never so happy
as when out at balls, at the theater, or at garden parties.
She lived in a whirl of excitement, and she
quarreled bitterly with me because I preferred a
quieter life. I accompanied her sometimes, but not
often enough to please her, and when we came to
reside at The Laurels after my leaving the army, she
frequently declared that she regretted having given up
Mark Jeringham for me. Naturally enough I resented
this plain speaking, and we were estranged. Not even
your birth could bridge over the abyss between us,
and, while we lived at The Laurels at Horriston, I
believe we were as unhappy and ill-matched a couple
as existed in England. It was the quick coupled with
the dead, and we both suffered accordingly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The first cause of our unhappiness was, as you see,
incompatibility of temper; the second was the presence
of Jeringham, who came to Horriston ostensibly
on a visit, in reality to stay near my wife.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You can easily understand that I resented the
presence of this young man. He was remarkably like
me in height, figure, and looks, and my wife had a
fancy for him before her marriage with me. That she
became my wife, she laughingly avowed, was because
of my uniform. So far as looks were concerned there
was nothing to choose between Jeringham and myself,
but the glitter of the military trappings (so she declared)
turned the balance in my favor. You may be
sure I liked Jeringham none the more after such a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page295" id="page295"></a>[pg&nbsp;295]</span>
declaration of lukewarm affection from your mother;
and when he came to reside at Horriston, four years
after our marriage, I resented his continued presence
about the house. Your mother was angry at my expostulations,
and the introduction of this second element
of discord into the house estranged us more
widely than ever. It was a miserable and most
unhappy time.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was my friend Hilliston who pointed out the
real reason for Jeringham&#39;s visits. This latter was
not in love with my wife, but with her maid, Mona
Bantry. As Denis, the brother of Mona, was an old
servant of mine, I did not care to speak to my wife
on the matter, but to keep the affair quiet, and to save
the girl from the anger of her brother, I discouraged
the visits of Jeringham on all possible occasions. We
had a quarrel in public, and, as all the gossips of Horriston
knew that he had been fond of my wife before
her marriage to me, the quarrel was set down to
jealousy on my part. All the neighborhood knew there
was bad blood between Jeringham and myself, and
(foolishly enough, I admit) I made use of several
expressions calculated to show my hatred. These
heated speeches were afterward remembered and commented
upon.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Things were in this position when the fancy dress
ball took place at Horriston. Hearing that it was to
be a masked ball, I resolved to assume a similar dress
to that of Jeringham, and learn from my wife&#39;s own
lips if she still cared for me. You may think I acted
in an unworthy manner, but as a matter of fact I was
nearly out of my mind with anger and jealousy, and
hardly knew what I was doing. My wife was going
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page296" id="page296"></a>[pg&nbsp;296]</span>
to the ball as Mary, Queen of Scots, accompanied
by Jeringham as Darnley. This was sufficiently
pointed to show in what direction her affections
leaned, and I took advantage of the opportunity.
Feigning an excuse, I ostensibly went to London,
but in reality remained at Horriston, where I obtained
from the costumer a similar dress to that worn by
Jeringham.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thus masked and disguised I repaired to the ball.
There I was recognized by a Miss Belinda Pike, but
she kindly consented to keep my secret. You can
guess what happened. Deceived by the dress my wife
took me for Jeringham, and I learned sufficient to
know that she loved him and hated me. I did not
reveal myself, but went away mad with wrath. My
sole idea was to unmask Jeringham, and show my wife
how unworthy he was of her love. To this end I
sought out Hilliston, and, learning that my wife was
shortly returning home, Hilliston and I went to The
Laurels together, as I intended to make Mona confess
that Jeringham was her lover. I left Hilliston outside
in the garden to watch for the coming of my wife, and
entered the house to see Mona. She was waiting in
the sitting room for her mistress, and I then and there
forced her to admit the truth. She declared that
Jeringham was the father of her unborn child, and
implored me not to tell her brother. Fortunately, I
had directed Denis to stay in the entrance hall, so he
did not hear his sister&#39;s confession, and she was safe
for the time being.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;While I was talking with Mona, my wife entered.
She immediately accused me of having feigned a visit
to London in order to stay at home with Mona. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page297" id="page297"></a>[pg&nbsp;297]</span>
girl slipped out of the room, and my wife continued
her ravings. She said that Jeringham had come home
with her and was at that moment in the garden; there
she swore to join him. I prevented her leaving the
room, and ultimately she fainted. I ran out to call
Mona, and found that she had left the house, no doubt
to join Jeringham in the garden, to tell him that the
secret was known. I also went into the garden to seek
for Jeringham. To my horror I stumbled over a dead
body, and hastily ran back for a light to see whose it
was. Denis came with the lantern, and we found it
was the corpse of Jeringham. He had been stabbed
to the heart.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I would have given the alarm, but that Denis,
quicker-witted than I at the moment, prevented me.
He pointed out that it was well-known that I was on
bad terms with Jeringham; that the unhappy man had
been murdered in my garden; that my hands were red
with the blood, and my clothes stained owing to handling
the corpse; and said that I would be accused of
the murder. I saw in a flash the peril in which I stood.
I don&#39;t know if Denis suspected me of the crime, as he
was not present when I first found the body, but he
acted the part of a friend. We threw the body into
the river and I made my preparations for flight. No
one but Hilliston and Miss Pike knew that I had
returned from London on that night, for my wife
would keep silence, as I thought, for her own sake, and
Mona had disappeared. I left the house in charge of
Denis, and without a word to my wife, who had
brought about this catastrophe, I sought safety in
flight. It was cowardly, if you like, but I had no other
resource. I would have been accused of the murder
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page298" id="page298"></a>[pg&nbsp;298]</span>
had I stayed, for the evidence was strong against me.
I fled and trusted to chance to hide the crime.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The rest you know. My wife was accused and
tried for my murder, as Jeringham&#39;s corpse was so
disfigured that it was thought to be mine. I have
mentioned the strong resemblance between us, and
this helped the deception. I was compelled to keep in
hiding as Jeringham, but I declare, had the case gone
against my wife, I should have come forward and told
all. As it was I went abroad, aided by Hilliston, who
acted as my friend all through. He looked after my
unhappy wife till she died in London; he took charge
of you and brought you up like a son. He also
secured me sufficient of my own property to live
quietly, so I came to Thorston under the name of
Paynton, and here I have lived ever since. I thought
to die in peace, but you, Claude, have reopened the
case. I tell you this to show you the futility of trying
to find the real murderer. I do not know who killed
Jeringham, nor do I think you will ever find out. If,
after reading this, you still consider me your father,
come at once to a most unhappy man. Be just, be
lenient, my son, and forgive your unhappy father,</p>

<p class="right">&quot;<span class="smcap">George Larcher</span>.&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="chXXXVIII" id="chXXXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XXXVIII.</h2>

<p class="h3">A NEW ASPECT OF THINGS.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Tait</span> folded over the last sheet of this long letter
with a sigh. Although he was pleased for Claude&#39;s
sake that George Larcher was still in the land of the
living, yet he was distinctly disappointed that no communication
had been made likely to elucidate the mystery.
Yet the result of this confession was an entire
displacement of the point whence it was necessary to
survey the case. The motives which had caused the
supposed death of Larcher would not suffice to explain
the death of Jeringham. The case had assumed a new
aspect, but nevertheless it was as complex and inexplicable
as ever. Tait thought of all this with inconceivable
rapidity, but did not give utterance to his
opinion in the presence of his friend.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The letter is wonderful, so far,&quot; was his sole
remark, &quot;but it is a great pity that it ends so abruptly.
I suppose your father will personally relate all other
details, Claude, when you see him again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The young man assumed a sitting position, and
deliberately finished his wine before replying to this
remark. He looked anxious and disturbed, and, now
that he had recovered from the overwhelming surprise
at finding his father alive, seemed less delighted
than he should have been. A miracle had been
wrought in his behalf; the dead had been restored to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page300" id="page300"></a>[pg&nbsp;300]</span>
life; but he was by no means gratified by the occurrence.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know whether I shall see my father again,&quot;
he said shortly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But, my dear friend&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I know all you would say,&quot; interrupted Claude
hastily, with a frown; &quot;but I am not prepared to admit
your arguments. My mother is alive, my father is in
existence, yet for twenty-five years I have looked on
them as dead. Can you, then, wonder that I feel awkward
toward them both; that I am by no means disposed
to render them that filial affection which, you
must admit, they but ill deserve?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The question is so delicate that I can only hold my
peace,&quot; said Tait, after a pause. &quot;I admit what you
say. Still they are your own flesh and blood.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I might answer you as <i>Hamlet</i> did on a like
occasion,&quot; replied Claude, with a bitter smile; &quot;but a
quotation will not mend matters. What I have to consider
is the advisability of seeing my father again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must certainly see him again,&quot; said the other
promptly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In the first place he is your father, whatever you
may say, and in the second you had better tell him
personally that you abandon further investigation of
the case. After all, your object is gone; for though
you might want to avenge the death of a parent, the
murder of a scamp like Jeringham can matter nothing
to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, that I abandon the case goes without speaking,&quot;
said Claude quickly, &quot;and you&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I act in the same way. The further we go into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page301" id="page301"></a>[pg&nbsp;301]</span>
case the more perplexing does it become. It is beyond
me. Only at the Last Day will the mystery be solved.
Still,&quot; added Tait meditatively, &quot;I must admit a
curiosity yet exists on my part to know who struck
the blow. Of course your father&#39;s story corroborates
Dicky Pental&#39;s, but the gardener mistook him for
Jeringham by reason of the fancy dress.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Does this letter suggest anything to you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It narrows the field of inquiry, that is all. Your
mother, your father, and Denis Bantry must necessarily
be innocent, as they were in the house when the
murder took place in the garden.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If they are innocent, who is guilty?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We have a choice of two who were outside at the
time. You can choose between Hilliston and Mona
Bantry.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mona Bantry kill her lover! How do you make
that out?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You forget your father&#39;s account of the scene in
the sitting room,&quot; said Tait significantly; &quot;then Mrs.
Larcher asserted in the presence of Mona that she had
come with Jeringham, furthermore, that he was in
the garden. Mona, also jealous, acts as any other
woman would have done in such a position. She goes
into the garden to demand an explanation; there is a
quarrel between her and Jeringham, and she kills him,
then flies, not to hide her disgrace, but to evade the
consequences of her act. That is a feasible theory,
I think.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Claude shook his head. &quot;I don&#39;t agree with you,&quot;
he said emphatically. &quot;You forget that we have my
mother&#39;s account of the matter to place against that
of my father&#39;s. If you recollect she also admitted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page302" id="page302"></a>[pg&nbsp;302]</span>
finding my father and Mona in the sitting room; she
also admits fainting, but there all resemblance between
the accounts ceases. My mother distinctly says that
she threatened her husband with the dagger, that it
fell on the floor when she lost her senses. When she
recovered them the dagger was gone. Now,&quot; continued
Claude slowly, &quot;if you remember, the crime was
committed by means of the dagger, for it was found
red with blood in the grounds, and then was taken
possession of by the police. If my mother&#39;s account
is the true one, Mona Bantry may certainly have picked
up the dagger and have murdered Jeringham, as you
suggest. But if my father&#39;s story is to be believed,
Mona left the room before my mother fainted, and
consequently could not have gained possession of the
dagger. It follows as a natural consequence that she
could not have committed the murder.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tait nodded several times during this explanation, to
show that he agreed with the points raised; but when
Claude concluded he rubbed his chin in some perplexity.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Here we come to a dead stop,&quot; said he impatiently.
&quot;It was asserted by the police that the murder was
committed with the dagger worn by your mother as
part of the fancy dress.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes! If you remember, it was on that evidence
she was arrested.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, if she wore that dagger in the sitting room,
Jeringham could not have been killed with it, because
the murder must have taken place while your father
was trying to pacify your mother.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Claude glanced at the letter again. &quot;My father
makes no mention of the dagger in this,&quot; he said, with
a puzzled look.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page303" id="page303"></a>[pg&nbsp;303]</span>
&quot;No. I should like to hear what he has to say on
the subject, the more so as I incline to his story rather
than to your mother&#39;s.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For what reason?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In her conversation with you, Mrs. Bezel&mdash;or rather
your mother&mdash;said that she had threatened your father
with the dagger in the sitting room of The Laurels.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. Well?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you remember the evidence given by her to the
police at the time of the arrest was that she had lost
the dagger at the ball, and knew not into whose hands
it had fallen.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Claude looked nonplussed, and knew not what
answer to make. That his mother had made two different
statements he was compelled to admit. He
further remembered that his father had made no
statement whatsoever about the dagger. Yet on the
possession of that dagger turned the whole of the case.
Whoever picked it up, whether at the ball or in the
sitting room, must have killed Jeringham. Assuming
his father&#39;s account to be true, and Claude saw no
reason to doubt its accuracy, Mona could not have
committed the murder, nor could Mr. or Mrs. Larcher
be guilty. It therefore followed that his mother had
spoken truly to the police, and for some inexplicable
reason falsely to him. The dagger must have been
lost at the ball, and picked up by&mdash;whom?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can make nothing of it,&quot; he said, after due consideration.
&quot;The only way to get at the truth is to tell
my father that his wife still lives, and bring them
together. Out of their meeting good may come.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You will then call and see your father,&quot; said Tait
encouragingly.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page304" id="page304"></a>[pg&nbsp;304]</span>
&quot;Yes. I must. I see no way out of it. He must
be informed that my mother lives, and I am the
proper person to tell him so. Though it is strange,&quot;
added Claude suddenly, &quot;that Hilliston never told
him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Humph! That gentleman seems to serve both
sides,&quot; said Tait gruffly. &quot;Your mother speaks well
of him, your father thinks no end of him, and both
trust him, yet for what I can see he has deceived
both.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, by keeping back the truth from each. He
has let your father think your mother dead, and <i>vice
versa</i>. What do you make of that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I tell you I can make nothing of the whole confusion,&quot;
said Claude crossly. &quot;I will see my father
and abandon the case, for I am sick of the affair. It
is maddening. What a pity your lunatic did not wake
up a few minutes earlier so as to see who struck the
blow and thus have settled the matter? But it is not
that which troubles me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No? What else disturbs your mind?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jenny.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jenny?&quot; echoed Tait, with feigned simplicity.
&quot;I am afraid I am dull. I don&#39;t see.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must be blind, then,&quot; retorted Claude, in an
exasperated tone. &quot;You know I love Jenny.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I can&#39;t love her. She is my half sister.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Indeed!&quot; said Tait, in nowise astonished at this
announcement. &quot;How do you make that out?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, isn&#39;t Jenny the daughter of Paynton, and
isn&#39;t he my father?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page305" id="page305"></a>[pg&nbsp;305]</span>
&quot;He is your father, certainly, but I assure you
Jenny is not his daughter. She is no relation to him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tait! what do you mean?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can&#39;t you guess?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No. Out with it, man! Don&#39;t keep me in suspense.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why,&quot; drawled Tait, enjoying the situation.
&quot;Jenny is the niece of Denis&mdash;in other words, she is
the child of Mona Bantry and Jeringham.&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="chXXXIX" id="chXXXIX"></a>CHAPTER XXXIX.</h2>

<p class="h3">THE GARNET SCARFPIN.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">That</span> same evening Claude called to see his father.
He decided to go alone, but asked Tait to repair to
Rose Cottage within the hour, so that, the meeting
with his newly found parent having taken place, a consultation
could be held by the three regarding the
proceeding with, or withdrawing, of the case. Tait
especially stipulated that this arrangement should be
come to, as he was desirous of seeing Mr. Larcher,
senior, in order to disabuse his mind of the straight-forwardness
of Hilliston. Privately, Tait believed that
the lawyer would yet be found guilty of the crime.
On no other grounds could he explain the attitude
taken up by Hilliston since the papers had been placed
in Claude&#39;s hands. The evidence of Miss Pike and
Dick Pental failed to alter his idea on this point.</p>

<p class="indent">Tait himself was beginning to feel weary of the investigation.
At every turn it took he was baffled by
some fresh obstacle, and he was not ill-pleased to find
that the matter was at an end so far as Claude was
concerned. That young man had sworn to avenge the
death of his father; but now that his father proved to
be still in existence, the oath was null and void. So
that, Claude married to Jenny, he would be quite willing
to leave the solution of the mystery surrounding
the death of Jeringham to Tait; but Tait himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page307" id="page307"></a>[pg&nbsp;307]</span>
determined to have nothing further to do with so
wearisome a problem.</p>

<p class="indent">He waited considerably beyond the hour before
leaving for the cottage, as he rightly considered the
father and son would have much to say to one another.
Moreover it was necessary to give Larcher time to
overcome his emotion on learning that his wife was
still in existence. Tait was by no means sure that the
old gentleman would be pleased with this revelation.
According to his own showing his relations with his
wife had been none of the best; and to renew those
relations after twenty-five years could hardly fail to be
most unpleasant.</p>

<p class="indent">During this time Tait gave no thought to Jenny or
Denis. As to the former, he was so satisfied that she
was the daughter of Jeringham by Mona Bantry that
he did not think it worth while to give the matter the
benefit of the doubt. What he was curious to know
was how Paynton, or rather Captain Larcher, came to
stand in the position of an adopted father. Information
on this point was conveyed to him before he
reached the cottage by Denis himself.</p>

<p class="indent">The old servant walked briskly along the road, looking
quite rejuvenated. He had heard the good news,
and it had transformed his life. In place of a crabbed
expression, his face appeared wonderfully cheerful, and
he saluted Tait with a grin of pleasure. The other
could not forbear commenting on his changed appearance,
so clearly apparent even in the waning light of
evening.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, Kerry, you look ten years younger,&quot; he said,
stopping short in his amazement, with an afterthought
of Dick Pental&#39;s accusation.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page308" id="page308"></a>[pg&nbsp;308]</span>
&quot;Ah, and I do that same, sir,&quot; said Denis, saluting
in military fashion, &quot;and you know why, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are they reconciled?&quot; asked Tait, guessing what
was in the mind of the old servant.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Begad, they are! Chattering together like two
love birds, and my old master looking on with
pride.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, Kerry, I spoke of Captain Larcher.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Augh, did you now, sir? I spoke of Master Claude,
God bless him, and Miss Jenny, God bless her! God
bless them both!&quot; cried Kerry, taking off his hat, with
a burst of affection, &quot;and his honor along with them.
Oh, glory be to the saints for this blessed day. But
sure, I am forgetting my service, sir. The master is
waiting to see you this very minute.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was just on my way,&quot; said Tait, signing to Kerry
to go on. &quot;We will walk there together. By the
way, does Miss Jenny know she is not the daughter of
your master?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She knew it all along, sir. Ah, and why should
you look surprised at that, Mr. Tait? Is it because
she is the niece of an old soldier like me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, no, Kerry! But, as you are aware, Miss
Jenny knows the case from those newspapers she
found; and in that report Jeringham&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I see what you mean, sir,&quot; said Kerry, touching
his hat in a deprecating manner; &quot;but sure she doesn&#39;t
know all. She believes herself to be the child of my
sister, Mona&mdash;who is dead, rest her soul, and of a Mr.
Kennedy. We&#39;ve invented a father for her, sir.
&#39;Twould never do for her to know she was the daughter
of the poor man who was killed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is just as well, Kerry. Do you know who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page309" id="page309"></a>[pg&nbsp;309]</span>
killed him?&quot; Tait asked this question with a keen
glance at the man.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, sir. How should I know. I ran out with the
light when the captain called, but I don&#39;t know who
struck him the cruel blow. He was a bad man, sir,
deceiving my sister, and disgracing the Bantry family,
but he is dead, and she is dead, so we&#39;ll let them rest,
and the heavens be their bed!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">By this time they were at the garden door, and
striking his hand over these sad memories Kerry led
the visitor into the house, and showed him into the
bookroom. Here were assembled Claude, his father,
and Jenny, all looking supremely happy, though the
old gentleman appeared to be rather shaken. He rose
when Tait entered and held out his hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am glad to see you, Mr. Tait,&quot; said he, in an
unsteady voice, &quot;and I thank you for the way in which
you have aided my son. I feel that an apology is due
to you for my behavior on your last visit.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t mention it,&quot; replied Tait cordially, shaking
the extended hand. &quot;Under the circumstances
you could not act otherwise. Well, Miss Paynton, am
I to&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t call me Miss Paynton now, Mr. Tait,&quot; she
said, smiling; &quot;there can be no need for further concealment.
I can take my own name, that of&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Miss Kennedy,&quot; said Tait quickly. &quot;Do not look
so surprised. Kerry told me all about it as I came
along. I am at once astonished and delighted.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t wonder at it,&quot; said Captain Larcher, patting
Claude&#39;s hand. &quot;You see I have found a son.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And soon, sir, you will lose a daughter,&quot; observed
Tait significantly.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page310" id="page310"></a>[pg&nbsp;310]</span>
&quot;Oh, no,&quot; observed Claude, with a laugh; &quot;when I
marry Jenny we will all live together as a happy family.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Marriage! Has it come to that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are astonished, I see, Mr. Tait,&quot; said the old
gentleman, shaking his head. &quot;I am myself. It is
too soon&mdash;too sudden. They have only known each
other a few weeks, and it is impossible that a union
on so short an acquaintance can prove happy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We will have a long engagement,&quot; said Claude,
&quot;in order to prove if we truly love one another.
But I am not afraid of the result.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Neither am I,&quot; remarked Jenny, slipping her arm
within that of her lover. &quot;I am sure nothing will
come between us. But come, Claude, and we will see
my uncle, for I notice that Mr. Tait is anxious to
speak to your father about that horrid case.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Captain Larcher nodded his approval of this, so
Claude and Jenny left the room to seek Kerry, and be
wept over by the old servant. Left alone with his
host, Tait took a chair by the table, and they looked
at one another in silence. The captain was the first to
break it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is no need for me to recapitulate the events
of the day,&quot; he said, with a weary sigh, &quot;as Claude
told me you read my letter, and are in possession of all
the facts. You may believe, Mr. Tait, that I feel considerably
shaken. My interview with Claude has been
rather trying. He has behaved in the most affectionate
manner.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, now your troubles are all at an end, Captain
Larcher, and&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;At an end, sir!&quot; he interrupted sharply. &quot;No,
they will continue. My innocence is not yet proved,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page311" id="page311"></a>[pg&nbsp;311]</span>
and I must still remain here under a feigned name,
unless you agree to help me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly I agree. Is it your intention and
Claude&#39;s to go on with the case?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We have come to that decision, but I wanted to
consult you before finally making up my mind. Do
you think we ought to proceed?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I certainly do,&quot; said Tait promptly. &quot;It is true
that the police think that you are the victim. But if
you want to assume your own name, inquiries would
certainly be made. One is never safe in these criminal
matters, even after the lapse of years. If you did
declare yourself to be Captain Larcher, then it would
come out that Jeringham is dead, and you would have
to clear yourself. Besides, the evidence of Dicky
Pental would implicate you, seeing that he mistook you
in that fancy dress for Jeringham.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;True enough,&quot; replied Larcher, nodding. &quot;And
there is another reason. I have just learned that my
wife is still alive, and is protected by Hilliston at
Hampstead. I sent Claude out of the room so that I
could ask you a plain question. Give me a plain
answer, and tell me what are the relations between
them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t care to answer that plainly,&quot; said Tait, with
some hesitation; &quot;but I think you can guess.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Does Hilliston love my wife?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;On the authority of Miss Belinda Pike, whom I
saw at Horriston, I believe he does.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And for her sake he had deceived me all these
years?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It seems so. In fact, Captain Larcher, Hilliston
has been playing a double game. He kept you and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page312" id="page312"></a>[pg&nbsp;312]</span>
your wife apart by assuring each that the other was
dead. That conduct alone stamps him as a villain.
Then, again, he threw all kinds of obstacles in the
way while we were investigating this case.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What for?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My own opinion is that Hilliston committed the
murder.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Captain Larcher clenched his hand, and thought for
a few moments.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It might be so,&quot; he muttered, more to himself than
to Tait. &quot;Hilliston was in the garden. If he loved
my wife&mdash;a fact which I never suspected&mdash;he might
have killed Jeringham out of jealousy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But the dagger! How did he obtain that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No doubt at the ball. I assure you, Mr. Tait,
that my wife had not the dagger when in the sitting
room.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She declares that she threatened you with it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then she either forgets or speaks falsely. She
wore it at the ball when I spoke to her there, but when
she returned it was missing. Hilliston came with me,
knowing Jeringham was with my wife. He might
have picked up the dagger with the fullest intention
of committing the crime. Now that I know he loved
my wife I am not prepared to say how he acted in the
garden while I was in the house.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And the garnet scarfpin mentioned in the novel?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That belonged to Hilliston,&quot; said Larcher quickly.
&quot;I gave it to him myself. Denis picked it up in the
garden, but I thought nothing of that, as I was aware
Hilliston was in the grounds on that night. But now
I believe&mdash;&mdash;Oh, I am afraid to say what I believe.
I may be wrong.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page313" id="page313"></a>[pg&nbsp;313]</span>
&quot;There is one way of finding out the truth, Captain
Larcher. Come up to town this week and see your
wife. Then we may learn all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The old gentleman leaned his head on his hand in
deep thought for a few minutes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will come,&quot; he said at length. &quot;At whatever
cost, I will force the guilty woman to own the truth.&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="chXL" id="chXL"></a>CHAPTER XL.</h2>

<p class="h3">FACE TO FACE.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> conversation between Tait and Captain Larcher
was not finished that evening, as the old gentleman,
worn out by the excitement of the day, early
retired to bed. However, he declared that he would
be shortly ready to journey to London; and Claude
left the Cottage with Tait on the understanding that his
father was to be called for next day. Before they parted
for the night Claude made a remark about Hilliston.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hope he won&#39;t get wind of this,&quot; he said dubiously;
&quot;or he may get Mrs. Bezel&mdash;I can&#39;t call her
mother&mdash;out of the way.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have no fear,&quot; replied Tait calmly. &quot;Hilliston&#39;s
hands are too full at present.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why,&quot; said Tait, lighting his candle; &quot;your
father showed me a letter from Hilliston, apologizing
for not coming over, as his wife was lying dangerously
ill at the Connaught Hotel, at Eastbourne.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He said something of that in his note to me.
What is the matter with Mrs. Hilliston?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She has the smallpox.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The smallpox!&quot; echoed Claude, in a tone of
horror. &quot;Poor creature, she is a dead woman!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know so much about that. She may
recover.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She may recover from the disease,&quot; said the young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page315" id="page315"></a>[pg&nbsp;315]</span>
man gloomily; &quot;but not from the blow to her vanity.
Many a time has she told me that if she lost her
looks she would kill herself. You mark my words,
Tait, within the week we will hear of her death.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And with these prophetic words Claude retired to
his room.</p>

<p class="indent">Tait had no time to think of this conversation, being
occupied with anticipation regarding the meeting of
Captain Larcher and his wife; but it so happened
that Claude&#39;s prognostications occurred to him when
the truth of the Horriston tragedy was discovered, and
that was not long afterward. Perhaps, like the young
men, Fate herself grew weary of an affair which had
dragged on for twenty-five years. At all events she
brought matters to a conclusion with almost inconceivable
rapidity.</p>

<p class="indent">The first step toward the end was the meeting of
husband and wife, which took place at Clarence Cottage,
Hampstead, during the afternoon of the next day.
In company with his son and Tait, the old gentleman
drove to the railway station, some three miles distant,
and took the up express. When established comfortably
in a first-class smoking carriage&mdash;for Captain Larcher
was fond of a pipe&mdash;he resumed the conversation
with Tait which had been broken off on the previous
night. This time the subject was Hilliston and his
doings.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have been thinking over your suspicions regarding
Hilliston,&quot; he said, addressing himself more directly
to Tait, &quot;and I confess that it is difficult to reconcile
some of his actions with your view that he is guilty.
Claude, as you know, was ignorant of the Horriston
tragedy until enlightened by Hilliston.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page316" id="page316"></a>[pg&nbsp;316]</span>
&quot;I know that, my dear sir,&quot; said Tait quietly,
&quot;Hilliston certainly placed the papers containing the
account of the matter in Claude&#39;s hands, but he was
forced to do so by the action of Mrs. Bezel&mdash;I beg
pardon, Mrs. Larcher.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Continue to call her Mrs. Bezel, if you please. I
prefer it so. How did she force Hilliston to confide in
Claude.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because she read the book &#39;A Whim of Fate,&#39;
and seeing the tragedy therein described, she wrote
asking Claude to see her with the intention of telling
him all. As you may guess, her story differs materially
from that of Hilliston&#39;s, so of two evils, choosing the
least, he determined to forestall her and inform Claude
of the matter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And he did so by means of the press,&quot; said Claude
eagerly. &quot;In place of telling me the story himself he
allowed me to gather what information I could from
the scanty report of the <i>Canterbury Observer</i>. My dear
father, the Genesis of the whole matter springs from
the finding of those papers by Jenny. Had she not
read them and told Linton the story he would not have
written the book; had he not done so Mrs. Bezel would
not have determined to tell me her version; and but
for her threat to do so Hilliston would not have produced
the papers.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Humph! The action was compulsory on the part
of Hilliston?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think so, sir,&quot; said Tait complacently; &quot;therefore
it is quite in keeping with his usual character.
The rat did not fight till it was driven into a corner.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is not in the corner,&quot; remarked Captain Larcher
significantly, &quot;but we&#39;ll drive it there and see if it will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page317" id="page317"></a>[pg&nbsp;317]</span>
face our accusation. But what about Hilliston&#39;s introduction
of Claude to me? Would it not have been to
his interest to keep us apart?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh!&quot; said Tait, with some contempt for Hilliston&#39;s
diplomacy, &quot;that was another case of necessity. He
knew that Claude and I were bent on discovering the
truth, so, fearing that we should do so by further investigation,
he thought to stop the whole matter by bringing
you face to face with your son.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t see how that would accomplish his aim.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hilliston hoped it would do so in two ways,&quot; explained
Tait glibly. &quot;First, he hoped that you would
give your consent to Claude marrying Jenny, and so
lead his mind away from the case, and second, he
trusted that when Claude found you alive he would no
longer desire to pursue the investigation.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He was right so far,&quot; said Claude seriously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If that was Hilliston&#39;s calculation, he made one
great mistake,&quot; said Captain Larcher scornfully.
&quot;He did not think that I should wish to see my wife.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He must have been satisfied that Claude would tell
you she was alive.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That, of course. But he thought I would stay at
Thorston as Ferdinand Paynton, and be afraid to admit
my identity even to my wife. I might have done so
but for Claude. But I owe it to him to clear myself,
and this meeting with my wife will be the first step
toward doing so. Between us we must solve the
mystery.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is none, so far as I am concerned,&quot; said Tait
grimly. &quot;I am sure as I am sitting here that Hilliston
murdered Jeringham. The gardener was just too late
to see him do the deed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page318" id="page318"></a>[pg&nbsp;318]</span>
&quot;But his motive?&quot; asked Claude curiously.</p>

<p class="indent">His father and Tait stole a glance at one another.
They neither of them wished to make any remarks
about Mrs. Larcher and Hilliston&#39;s passion, preferring
that Claude should be ignorant of that episode. Still
when he asked so direct a question it was difficult to
avoid a direct answer, but Larcher gave him one which
was sufficiently evasive to stop further inquiries.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We must try and find out his motive,&quot; he said
quietly. &quot;Depend upon it, Claude, there is a good
deal of underhand work in this of which we know
nothing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you think Mona committed the crime?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I do not. In no way could she have gained
possession of the dagger with which it was committed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My mother says she had a dagger in the sitting
room.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is a mistake,&quot; said Captain Larcher, using as
delicate a word as he could think of. &quot;She threatened
me with the sheath of the dagger, and no doubt, being
agitated at the time, she thought it was the weapon
itself. But I noticed when she entered the room that
the sheath was empty. Her story to the police at the
time of the trial is more likely. She lost it in the ballroom.
The question is, who picked it up? Judging
from the knowledge I now have of his character I believe
it was Hilliston who did so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Or Jeringham,&quot; said Tait suddenly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Impossible! How could Jeringham have found
it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He was with Mrs. Larcher all the evening, and
may have seen the dagger fall. Or again, he may
have taken it out of the sheath to examine it and have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page319" id="page319"></a>[pg&nbsp;319]</span>
forgotten to return it. It is not improbable that in
such a case he might have recollected it when he was
in the garden, and offered it to Mona to return to her
mistress.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh!&quot; said Claude with contempt. &quot;And on that
slight ground you suppose that Mona killed him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is not beyond the bounds of probability.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nonsense!&quot; said Captain Larcher angrily. &quot;I
don&#39;t believe it. Mona was a good girl, foully deceived
by Jeringham. She fled from the house to hide
her disgrace, thinking my wife would tell her brother.
Hilliston afterward met her in London, where she
died in giving birth to Jenny.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then it was Hilliston who brought Jenny to you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. Because her Uncle Denis was in my service.
I adopted Jenny, but told her that she was the child of
a Mr. Kennedy and Mona Bantry. She believed her
father and mother were married, so do not disturb that
view of the case.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly not,&quot; said Tait emphatically. &quot;It would
be cruel to do so. But here we are at Victoria.
After seeing Mrs. Bezel at Hampstead we can resume
our conversation.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If we do it will be from a different standpoint, I
fancy,&quot; said Larcher significantly, as the train stopped.</p>

<p class="indent">Tait&#39;s brougham was waiting for them at the station,
and in this they drove up to Hampstead. Leaving it
in Fitzjohn&#39;s Avenue they walked down Hunt Lane
to Clarence Cottage. Mrs. Bezel occupied her usual
seat in the window, and caught sight of Claude as he
preceded his father and Tait up the path. A terrified
expression crossed her face, but she made no motion
to forbid their entrance. Yet a sense of coming evil
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page320" id="page320"></a>[pg&nbsp;320]</span>
struck at her heart, and it needed all her self-control
to prevent herself from fainting when they were shown
into the room.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear mother,&quot; said Claude, kissing her, &quot;you
must be prepared for unexpected news. I beg of you
to control yourself for&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He stopped short in astonishment. Mrs. Bezel was
looking at Captain Larcher with a bewildered air, and
he gazed at her face with an expression of amazement.
She shrank back as he crossed the room with rapidity,
and bent over her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mona Bantry!&quot; he cried, &quot;is it possible that you
still live?&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="chXLI" id="chXLI"></a>CHAPTER XLI.</h2>

<p class="h3">AN EXPLANATION.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">On</span> hearing his father&#39;s exclamation Claude turned
round with a look of supreme astonishment. He
could not understand the meaning of that sudden
exclamation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Father, you do not understand. This is your
wife&mdash;my mother.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is it, indeed?&quot; sneered Captain Larcher, who had
recovered from his momentary emotion. &quot;Nothing
of the sort, sir. This woman is Mona Bantry, who
was my wife&#39;s maid.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you sure?&quot; cried Tait, who was beginning to
be bewildered by these successive revelations.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sure, sir! as sure as I am of my own innocence.
As sure as I am George Larcher, this is the sister of
Denis Bantry, who&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Denis!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The interruption came from Mrs. Bezel. She had
sat dumfounded at the unexpected appearance of the
man whom she had thought dead, and she had said
nothing while assertion and denial were going on, but
the mention of her brother&#39;s name stirred her dormant
faculties, and she sat up looking wildly around.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Denis!&quot; she cried, in a terrified tone. &quot;Is Denis
here?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Denis is down at Thorston,&quot; said Captain Larcher
gruffly, &quot;as you no doubt knew well enough.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page322" id="page322"></a>[pg&nbsp;322]</span>
&quot;I swear I did not. Francis told me Denis was in
America.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Francis?&quot; exclaimed Claude, forgetting to whom
the name belonged.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Francis Hilliston.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah!&quot; said Captain Larcher, with a disdainful look
round. &quot;I might have guessed as much. Off with
the dead love, on with the living. You have amended
the proverb.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I did not know Mark was dead, sir,&quot; exclaimed
Mrs. Bezel passionately. &quot;Francis said that he had
gone to America with Denis. I thought he had done
so to escape the consequences of his crime, but&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of his crime!&quot; cried Claude. &quot;He was the
victim, poor soul, not the murderer. It was Jeringham
who was killed, not my father.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your father?&quot; said Mrs. Bezel, looking steadily at
Captain Larcher. &quot;Yes; it is my old master. So
you are alive and he is dead. Why did you kill him,
sir?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I did not kill him,&quot; replied the captain quietly,
&quot;and as a counter question, may I ask why you passed
yourself off to Claude as my wife?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Bezel burst into a wild laugh, and clapped her
hands together. Then she covered her face and
commenced to weep, but in a few moments the fit of
hysteria passed away, and she became cool and composed.
Thrown off her balance for the time being,
she had now gathered her wits together, and was ready
to fight. Her folly and impulse had brought about
this catastrophe, and it was her duty to set it right
again&mdash;if she could. But the upshot of the matter was
extremely doubtful.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page323" id="page323"></a>[pg&nbsp;323]</span>
On his part, Captain Larcher was relieved to find
that Mrs. Bezel proved to be Mona Bantry instead of
his wife. Ever since the communication made by
Claude, he had suffered agonies at the thought that
his wife had been living all these years under the protection
of his false friend. Now that fear was set at
rest once and forever. Julia Larcher had really died,
as Hilliston had asserted, and the woman in Clarence
Cottage, who had taken her name, was the maid in
place of the mistress. Out of all the trouble Larcher
extracted this morsel of comfort, his honor was
unstained.</p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile the three visitors sat waiting to hear
what Mrs. Bezel had to say. She saw that they expected
a confession, and resolved to disappoint them.
Leaning backward among her cushions, she closed her
eyes, and played a waiting game. It proved successful,
for in two minutes or thereabouts Captain Larcher
broke out. His temper was none of the best, and
recent events had not tended to improve it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, madam,&quot; he said sharply, rapping his stick
on the ground, &quot;I am waiting to hear what you have
to say.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have nothing to say,&quot; said Mrs. Bezel quietly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes, you have,&quot; began Tait. &quot;As you set the
ball&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But at this moment he was interrupted by Larcher.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I beg your pardon, Mr. Tait, but I will question
this woman myself. Pray do not speak, nor you,
Claude, till I have done.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Both young men bowed their heads and acquiesced
in silence. After all, the captain was the proper person
to examine Mona Bantry. He knew more of the case
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page324" id="page324"></a>[pg&nbsp;324]</span>
than anyone else, and conversant as he was with the
events of that fatal night, he would know whether she
spoke truly or falsely. Mrs. Bezel looked uneasy on
hearing his resolution, but only compressed her lips
tighter as though resolved to let nothing escape her.
But he was a match for her in obstinacy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now then,&quot; said Larcher, turning to her, &quot;relate
your history from the moment you left me alone with
my wife twenty-five years ago at The Laurels.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It would not help you if I did.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m not so sure of that. But I understand. You
are afraid of incriminating yourself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I!&quot; exclaimed Mrs. Bezel indignantly. &quot;What
have I to do with the matter. I know nothing of it.
I left the house then and there, and only heard of the
tragedy while I was concealed at Horriston, more than
a week afterward.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why did you state to my son that Mrs. Larcher
threatened me with the dagger.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So she did,&quot; said Mrs. Bezel coolly. &quot;I saw her
hand raised, I saw the dagger in it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You saw the sheath of the dagger, you mean,&quot;
retorted Larcher; &quot;it fell on the floor and was found
there next day. But the weapon with which the crime
was committed was lost by my wife at the ball.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It may have been,&quot; said the woman indifferently.
&quot;I don&#39;t know anything about it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did not Jeringham show it to you when you joined
him in the garden?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I tell you I did not see him on that night. When
you found out my secret, I was afraid that you and
the mistress would betray it to my brother Denis, so I
left the room and fled. I thought Jeringham would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page325" id="page325"></a>[pg&nbsp;325]</span>
join me at Horriston next day, but then I heard of
your supposed death, and that he had fled. Until this
hour I did not know that it was the other way round.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did not Hilliston tell you? He knew.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, Captain Larcher, he did not,&quot; said Mrs. Bezel
emphatically. &quot;He said that Jeringham had gone to
America with my brother.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where did you go after leaving Horriston?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I came to London, and remained there till my baby
was born.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And then?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I found that my money had come to an end, and
called at Mr. Hilliston&#39;s office to ask him to help me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What right had you to expect help from him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I had no right, but that I knew he would assist me
because of his love.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;His love!&quot; exclaimed Larcher sharply. &quot;Did
Hilliston love you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; I refused to have anything to do with him on
account of Jeringham. But he did love me. Oh, yes,
I know you thought he was in love with your wife, but
such was not the case. He loved me, and me only.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Larcher drew a long breath, and looked puzzled.
He was relieved to find that he had not been mistaken
in Hilliston, after all, yet the assertion of Mrs. Bezel
only seemed to further complicate the case. If Hilliston
did not love Mrs. Larcher, what possible motive
could he have to kill Jeringham? The looks of
Claude and Tait reflected his perplexity; but dismissing
this special point for the moment, he pursued his
examination.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How did Hilliston receive you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Bezel looked around with a bitter smile. Her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page326" id="page326"></a>[pg&nbsp;326]</span>
meaning was clear from the contemptuous expression
on her face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can you not guess from what you see here?&quot; she
said quietly. &quot;Francis Hilliston bought me. He
loved me well enough, but not sufficiently to marry
me. He did not ruin me, for I was already ruined.
I accepted his offer to come here and be his mistress.
What else could I do? I was alone in London. I was
friendless. I believed that my lover and my brother
had fled to America. I could not return to Horriston
lest I might be involved in the tragedy at The Laurels.
I did what any other woman would have done, and
made the best of a bad business. I accepted the love
and protection of Francis Hilliston. The protection
still continues, as you see&mdash;the love, that is dead and
done with.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I see you are thinking of Louisa Sinclair,&quot; interposed
Tait quietly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you know of Louisa Sinclair?&quot; asked
Mrs. Bezel, with a violent start.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Everything, thanks to you,&quot; answered Tait.
&quot;Your letter put the clew into my head. I went to
Horriston; I saw a portrait of Miss Sinclair. I know
that she went to America after the tragedy, and
returned as Mrs. Derrick, rich and beautiful, to marry
Hilliston.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, you know that much. Yes! Louisa Sinclair
is my rival! Ten years ago she came back to England
and wanted Francis to marry her. I fell ill&mdash;I became
paralyzed. He forgot me, he forgot my love, and she
became his wife. Oh, how I hate her! I hate him.
It was on that account that I wrote to you, Claude, to
reveal all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page327" id="page327"></a>[pg&nbsp;327]</span>
&quot;You then acted out of revenge!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I did!&quot; said Mrs. Bezel sullenly. &quot;Look
at me, a wreck; look at her, his wife, rich and handsome
and healthy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not healthy, poor soul,&quot; said Claude. &quot;She is ill
with the smallpox.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;With the smallpox,&quot; echoed Mrs. Bezel joyfully.
&quot;I&#39;m glad of it! I&#39;m glad of it! Her beauty will
depart, as mine has done. Then Francis may come
back to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You love him still?&quot; asked Captain Larcher, in
wonderment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Too well to ruin him. You want me to accuse him
of the crime, but I tell you he is innocent; he knows
nothing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He was in the garden alone on that night. None
other but he&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He was not alone,&quot; cried Mrs. Bezel sharply.
&quot;Louisa Sinclair was with him. Yes, she followed
him from the ball because she was jealous of me. In
my flight I passed her at the gate. She had a cloak
over her dress, but I saw that it was the costume of
Mary, Queen of Scots.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you knew her by that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Partly. My mistress told me that Miss Sinclair
had a similar costume to her own, for she was very
angry about it. But I saw her face as I fled. She
may know who killed Jeringham. I do not. Hilliston
does not. Now, I have told you all. Go away and
leave me. I speak no more.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;First tell us why you declared yourself to be my
mother?&quot; said Claude sharply.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For safety. I regretted that I had told you; that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page328" id="page328"></a>[pg&nbsp;328]</span>
I had forced Hilliston into defending himself. I was
afraid lest you should learn too much and denounce me
as the criminal. So long as you thought I was your
mother you would not dare to do so, and therefore
I told you I was Mrs. Larcher.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;One last word,&quot; said Captain Larcher, rising to his
feet. &quot;Your child. What became of it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hilliston took it away,&quot; said Mrs. Bezel, in a
melancholy tone. &quot;I was ill at the time and he overcame
my scruples. I don&#39;t know where my child is.
Often and often have I wanted to see her again, but
Francis has always refused. Oh, where can she be?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can tell you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You?&quot; cried Mrs. Bezel, starting up in amazement.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. Your daughter Jenny was brought by Hilliston
to me. I adopted her as my child, and she is now
at Thorston with her Uncle Denis&mdash;your brother.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Bezel tried to speak, but could not. With a
wild glance around she heaved a long sigh and fainted.
The joy of hearing that her child was alive proved too
much for her enfeebled frame.</p>

<h2><a name="chXLII" id="chXLII"></a>CHAPTER XLII.</h2>

<p class="h3">THE TRAGEDY OF A WOMAN&#39;S VANITY.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Meantime</span> Hilliston, unaware of that fatal meeting
with Mona Bantry, which threatened to demoralize his
plans, was devoting himself to his unfortunate wife.
She was very ill, and not expected to recover, so feeling
that he would soon lose her, the lawyer stayed constantly
by her side, and strove, though unsuccessfully,
to ameliorate her cruel sufferings. It was all the more
credit to him that he did so, as he had married her
mainly for her money, and was still in love with Mrs.
Bezel. No doubt, remorse had something to do with
his present attitude.</p>

<p class="indent">The landlord of the Connaught Hotel had insisted
upon Mrs. Hilliston being removed when the first
symptoms of disease showed themselves. He declared
that were it known that he had a smallpox patient in
his house, he would be ruined for the season, so Hilliston,
recognizing the truth of this assertion, took steps
to isolate his wife, as was necessary from the nature
of her illness. Assisted by the doctor, who attended
to all details relative to the municipal authorities, he
hired a small house on the outskirts of Eastbourne, and
thither the wreck of what had once been a beautiful
woman was removed one evening. Nurses were hired
from London, Hilliston sent word to his partner that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page330" id="page330"></a>[pg&nbsp;330]</span>
he would not return to business for some weeks; and
then began the slow martyrdom of the sickroom.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a fortnight since Mrs. Hilliston had been
seized with the disease, and now it had taken so favorable
a turn that the doctor held out great hopes that
she would recover. But the beauty of which she had
been so proud was gone, and with it went the hopes
that she could still retain her husband by her side.
Mrs. Hilliston knew well enough that it was only her
persistence which had made Hilliston marry her, and
now that she had lost her good looks&mdash;the one hold she
had on his lukewarm affection&mdash;she foresaw only too
clearly that he would neglect her in the future. Moreover,
the woman&#39;s vanity was so powerful that she
could not accept calmly the possibility of surviving, a
scarred and maimed object, to face looks of pity and
of horror. She felt that she would rather die, and in
fact resolved to do so. Meanwhile she tossed and
turned, and moaned and wept on her sick bed; crying
out against the stern Fate which had dealt her such
hard measure. Yet in her secret soul she admitted
that the punishment was just.</p>

<p class="indent">Hilliston was scarcely less unhappy than his wife.
While her illness was serious, he had thought of
nothing but how to save her, but now that a chance of
recovery offered a respite from his arduous attendance
by the sick bed, he had time to turn his thoughts
toward the Horriston tragedy. He wondered that he
had not heard from Paynton relative to the interview
with Claude, and, fearful lest some untoward event had
occurred to upset his plans, he wrote to Rose Cottage
asking for information. To-day he had received a
reply, and on reading it saw his worst fears realized.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page331" id="page331"></a>[pg&nbsp;331]</span>
&quot;I know you now [wrote Captain Larcher briefly].
I have seen Claude; I have seen Mona. Henceforth
I look upon you as an enemy, and I intend to take
immediate steps to clear my name at your expense.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">There was no signature, but Hilliston was too well
acquainted with his friend&#39;s writing to have any doubt
as to the genuineness of the letter. The blow had
fallen; Mona had betrayed him, and he sat there helpless,
with the letter in his hand, a spectacle of baffled
scheming, of unmasked villany.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To clear his name at my expense,&quot; muttered
Hilliston to himself. &quot;What does he mean by that?
He cannot have discovered&mdash;but no, that is impossible.
When they find out who picked up that dagger at the
ball, they may learn the truth, but not till then. I
defy them all. Larcher will remain Paynton till the
end of his life. Mona! Ah, I shall punish her when
I return to town for her cruel treachery.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">While he was thus thinking, a nurse entered the
room to intimate that Mrs. Hilliston would like to
see him. The lawyer obeyed the summons at once,
placed Larcher&#39;s letter in his pocket, smoothed his
brow, and entered the sickroom. Signing to the
nurse to go away, Mrs. Hilliston waited till she was
alone with her husband.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Francis,&quot; she said in a low voice, stretching out
her hand, &quot;I wish to speak to you&mdash;on that subject.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think it would be wise if you refrained from
doing so,&quot; replied Hilliston, knowing to what she
alluded. &quot;We understand one another on that point;
you can do no good by bringing it up again. Why
should you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page332" id="page332"></a>[pg&nbsp;332]</span>
&quot;For Claude&#39;s sake,&quot; said Mrs. Hilliston feverishly.
&quot;You owe him some reparation.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I owe him none, Louisa. I have acted like a
father to him, and he has turned on me. I helped
Larcher to hide himself when it was dangerous for
him to become known, and he tells me that I am his
enemy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you heard from him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I received a curt note of three lines intimating
that he was about to assert his innocence, and clear
his name at my expense.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Francis,&quot; cried Mrs. Hilliston, in a tone of terror,
&quot;you are lost! If all is known&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All will not be known,&quot; replied Hilliston, patting
her hand; &quot;only two people know the truth&mdash;you and
I. We can keep our own counsel.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But that little man, Tait, is at Horriston.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What of that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He will see Belinda Pike there. You know how
she hated me because I loved you. She wanted to
marry you herself. If he meets Miss Pike she will
speak against me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What of that?&quot; said Hilliston soothingly. &quot;You
forget, my dear, that your life is different now. No
one can find Louisa Sinclair in Louisa Hilliston.
When you went to America you vanished and returned
as Mrs. Derrick, the rich widow. Belinda Pike can
never learn that. My dear, you distress yourself suddenly.
We are perfectly safe.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But the garnet scarfpin,&quot; questioned Mrs. Hilliston
feverishly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am secure on that point. Larcher knew that I
was in the garden on that night, and may have thought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page333" id="page333"></a>[pg&nbsp;333]</span>
I dropped it. He will not dare to accuse me of the
crime. If he did,&quot; continued Hilliston, his brow
growing black, &quot;I could turn the tables on him in a
manner he little expects. There is more evidence
against him than against me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But if they learn that I was with you on that
night?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They will never learn. No one saw you there.
If they did, what does it matter? Louisa Sinclair is
dead. You need have no fear of being recognized.
I&#39;ll answer for that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It does not matter to me if I am known or not,&quot;
said Mrs. Hilliston gloomily; &quot;I have done with
life.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear, the doctor says you will recover.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall not recover,&quot; said the sick woman, with
emphasis. &quot;Oh, do not deceive yourself, Francis!
I shall never rise from this sick bed to be an object
of horror and pity to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You never loved me. You only married me out
of pity. At Horriston you refused to make me your
wife, and it was only when I returned from America
a rich woman that you did so. Pity,&quot; she said, with
a scornful laugh, &quot;no, not pity, but necessity. You
would have been ruined but for my money.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I admit it, Louisa, and I am deeply grateful to
you for the way in which you have helped me. I can
never repay you for saving my name and credit.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You can, Francis. Get me my dressing case.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Louisa, you cannot&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I insist upon being obeyed,&quot; she said imperiously.
&quot;Get me my dressing case.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page334" id="page334"></a>[pg&nbsp;334]</span>
With great reluctance he brought it from a distant
table and placed it on a chair by the bedside. In
obedience to her directions he opened it, and took
therefrom a sealed envelope.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In there,&quot; she said, as he held it in his hand, &quot;is
an account of all I saw on that fatal night. You must
send that letter to Captain Larcher when I am dead.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Louisa, do you wish to ruin me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wish to save you, Francis. Do not deceive yourself
into a belief that the investigation is at an end.
Claude may cease to meddle with the matter, for he is
in love with Jenny, and will probably marry her, for
by this time, according to you, he knows who she is.
But I am afraid of Spenser Tait. He will hunt you
down; he will urge Larcher to find out the truth. If
it comes to that, send them my account of the matter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It will ruin me,&quot; he said again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It will save you,&quot; she repeated. &quot;Do not be
foolish, Francis. You can read it before sending it
away.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall be dead. I feel sure I shall not live.
Promise me that if the worst comes you will send that
letter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I promise,&quot; he said, sorely against his will, &quot;but
it will not be sent: you will live.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t think so, Francis. I know better than the
doctor. Now kiss me, my husband, and leave me to
myself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He did so in silence, and took up the dressing-case,
whereupon she stopped him. &quot;Let it be,&quot; she said
quietly: &quot;some of your letters are in it, and I wish to
read them. Kiss me again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page335" id="page335"></a>[pg&nbsp;335]</span>
Again he kissed her, and reluctantly left the room.
So quiet and self contained was she that he had no
inkling of her intention. Had he guessed her fatal
resolve, little as was the love he bore her, he would
surely have striven to turn her from her purpose.
But he guessed nothing, and left her alone, with the
devil tempting her.</p>

<p class="indent">Good-by, my husband!&quot; she murmured, as the door
closed, and then burst into tears. He had gone, she
would never see him again, and she moaned over her
lost beauty which failed to retain him by her side.
He was coldly polite; he was affectionate out of pity,
but he had no love for her, and she hungered for the
want of it. Her life passed before her, episode after
episode, till it stopped short at the spectacle of a
closed door, and herself lying alone and deserted in
that sickroom.</p>

<p class="indent">She wept and prayed, and then, with a firm hand,
took out of her dressing case a small vial filled with a
dark brown liquid. Twice she put it to her lips, and
twice she hesitated; the third time she accomplished
her purpose. The thought of her lost beauty, of her
husband&#39;s neglect, of her childless home and wretched
future, all these nerved her, and she drank off the contents,
then quickly replaced the bottle in the dressing
case.</p>

<p class="indent">When the nurse came in to see her patient, Mrs.
Hilliston was lying back with a quiet smile on her pale
lips. She had found peace at last.</p>

<h2><a name="chXLIII" id="chXLIII"></a>CHAPTER XLIII.</h2>

<p class="h3">THE LAST APPEARANCE OF FRANCIS HILLISTON.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Unaware</span> of the tragedy which had taken place at
Eastbourne, Captain Larcher was in London brooding
over his wrongs, and weaving schemes how to avenge
himself on Hilliston. His eyes had been opened by
Tait with regard to the conduct of that gentleman,
and he now saw plainly that he had been Hilliston&#39;s
dupe for all these years. Indeed, he began to share
Tait&#39;s opinion that the lawyer was guilty, and was
casting about in his own mind how to prove this,
when an announcement in the papers informed him of
the death of Mrs. Hilliston.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The smallpox killed her, no doubt,&quot; said Tait,
when he had expressed his regrets.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No!&quot; remarked Claude, who had been looking
over the general news. &quot;It was a case of suicide.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Suicide!&quot; exclaimed the hearers, in one breath.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, according to this paragraph. It appears
that in some way or another she became possessed of
a bottle of laudanum while the nurse was absent. The
woman returned to find her patient dead. Poor Mrs.
Hilliston!&quot; added Claude, folding up the paper with a
sigh. &quot;How sorry I am to hear this.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wonder why she committed suicide?&quot; said Tait
meditatively. &quot;She looked too determined a woman
to yield to such a weakness.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page337" id="page337"></a>[pg&nbsp;337]</span>
&quot;No doubt she found out that her husband was
guilty of the crime,&quot; said Larcher grimly, &quot;and so
did not care to live longer with a murderer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are wrong, father,&quot; observed Claude, looking
up; &quot;it was the knowledge that she had lost her looks
which killed her. Depend upon it, she took the poison
so as to avoid dragging out her days a scarred and
miserable object.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How do you know that, Claude?&quot; asked his
father, with a curious look on his face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because not once, but twice, or thrice, Mrs. Hilliston
told me she would kill herself rather than grow
old and ugly. The loss of beauty came with the
smallpox; and so she has carried out her resolve.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It will be a blow to Hilliston.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t think so,&quot; said Captain Larcher rather
cynically. &quot;From what I remember of Louisa Sinclair,
the love was all on her side. No doubt he married
her when she was Mrs. Derrick purely for her
money. No! No! I quite believe the story of Mona
Bantry. She was and is the woman of his love. Now the
wife is dead he can console himself with the mistress.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That reminds me,&quot; observed Claude suddenly.
&quot;What are we to do about Jenny? Is she to be
informed that her mother is yet alive?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Captain Larcher shook his head. &quot;Set your mind
at rest on that point,&quot; he said with a nod. &quot;I told
Mrs. Bezel that Jenny was about to become your wife;
that she thinks her parents are dead; and I pointed
out that it would be unwise to mar the happiness of
the girl by letting her know the truth. Mrs. Bezel
agrees with me, and she has consented that things
shall remain as they are.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page338" id="page338"></a>[pg&nbsp;338]</span>
&quot;Does she not want to see Jenny, father?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course she does. It is only natural, poor soul,
but she loves her child sufficiently to avoid casting a
shadow on her life. Jenny will never know that Jeringham
was her father or that her mother is still alive.
She will marry you, Claude, as Miss Kennedy, and
know no more of her connection with the matter than
she does at present.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And Denis?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Denis has been told. I wrote him two days ago,
and I have no doubt he will come up to town to see
the last of his wretched sister.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The last of her?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can you doubt it? Mrs. Bezel has death written
on her face.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Another blow for Hilliston,&quot; said Tait, in a rather
regretful tone. Villain as he knew the lawyer to be,
he could not help feeling sorry for his troubles. Fate
had held her hand a long time, but now she was dealing
a full measure, and pouring the vials of her wrath
on the head of the sinner.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It will be a heavier blow than the last,&quot; said
Larcher, in a severe tone, &quot;for there is no doubt Hilliston
truly loves Mona.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose Denis will object to his going near her
again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is impossible to say. We must leave that to
the man himself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This conversation took place in Tait&#39;s rooms one
morning some three weeks after the momentous interview
with Mrs. Bezel. It had been Captain Larcher&#39;s
intention to return at once to Thorston, but he had
been dissuaded from this by his son, who thought a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page339" id="page339"></a>[pg&nbsp;339]</span>
few weeks in town would do his father good. There
was no doubt on this point, for Captain Larcher
brisked up wonderfully in the exhilarating atmosphere
of the West End. But for the unexplained mystery
of Jeringham&#39;s death, he would have been quite happy
in the recovered society of his son, and even while the
future was still black enjoyed himself in no small
degree. It did Claude good to see that his father was
at length getting some pleasure out of life, after his
years of incessant trouble and wearing anxiety.</p>

<p class="indent">The next day Denis, looking older and grayer
than ever, came up to see his sister. He saw his
master for a few minutes, and then went on to Hampstead.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have told Denis how ill she is,&quot; explained Captain
Larcher, as the man took his departure, &quot;and he
has promised to be as lenient as possible toward her
wrong-doing. By the way, Hilliston is in town.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hilliston!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. He came up in the same train as Denis, and
had the impudence to speak to him. Asked him where
I was, as he wanted to see me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To see you, father?&quot; cried Claude, in astonishment.
&quot;What for?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think I can guess,&quot; interposed Tait quietly,
&quot;Hilliston has been stricken by his wife&#39;s death, and
wants to atone for his sins by confessing the truth. I
would not be surprised if he called here this afternoon.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Captain Larcher looked skeptical, but said nothing,
and the matter dropped for the time being. As it
happened Denis was still ignorant that his sister had
been the mistress of the lawyer, else there might have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page340" id="page340"></a>[pg&nbsp;340]</span>
been trouble. He had but a confused idea of Hilliston&#39;s
connection with the case, and, beyond knowing
that he was the owner of the garnet scarfpin, could not
conceive that he had been actually present in the
garden when the murder was committed. True it was
that the scarfpin had been found on the spot where
the corpse of Jeringham had lain, but assured by his
master that Hilliston was innocent, as Captain Larcher
had truly believed these many years, Denis never gave
the matter a second thought. Now he would learn
the truth from Mrs. Bezel.</p>

<p class="indent">Denis only came back in the afternoon, looking much
put out. The ruin of his much loved sister by Jeringham
had been a great blow to him, but the discovery
that she was alive and had been living in sin with
Hilliston startled him considerably. He could hardly
reply to the questions of his master, but ultimately
related that they had parted friends. Mrs. Bezel had
told him that the doctor assured her she could not live
much longer; and in the shadow of death Denis had
freely forgiven her all her sins and follies.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And, indeed, sir, what else could I do,&quot; said
Denis, wiping the tears from his eyes, &quot;when I saw
the poor thing lying there like a corpse? It&#39;s a bitter
time she&#39;s had of it, these last ten years, in that death-in-life
state. Oh yes, captain, I forgave her freely,
poor soul!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And Hilliston?&quot; asked Larcher inquiringly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;May his black soul burn,&quot; cried Denis, with a
scowl. &quot;Were I or he younger I&#39;d leave my mark on
him. Mona had a letter from him saying he was
calling to see her this evening, but that he had an
appointment with you, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page341" id="page341"></a>[pg&nbsp;341]</span>
&quot;With me, Denis! It is the first I have heard of it.
Where is he?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At this moment, as if in response to his question,
the door opened and Tait appeared, looking very disturbed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Hilliston is here, Captain Larcher, and wishes
to speak with you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Claude had entered the room by another door, and,
on hearing this, stepped forward looking slightly pale.
He slipped his arm within that of his father, as though
to protect the elder man. Then they all waited to
hear what Captain Larcher had to say. The permission
for the interview must come from the man
who had been most deeply wronged. He thought for
a moment or so with a frown on his face, then sank
into a chair with a deep sigh.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Denis, stand behind me,&quot; he said, in a peremptory
tone. &quot;Claude, sit down yonder. Now, Mr. Tait, we
are ready to see our friend.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tait anticipated this permission, and was already
prepared for it. Without a word he threw open the
door, and Hilliston, dressed in deep mourning, entered
the room with a paper in his hand. He looked pale
and worn, his fresh color was gone, and as he spoke he
kept his eyes persistently on the ground. It could be
easily seen that the man had received a shock from
which he would not easily recover.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have called to see you and deliver this,&quot; he said,
in a low tone, placing the paper he carried on the
table. &quot;I do not ask your forgiveness, Larcher, for I
do not consider I have done anything to justify your
anger against me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You could have saved me all these years of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page342" id="page342"></a>[pg&nbsp;342]</span>
anguish by telling me the truth,&quot; said Larcher
indignantly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps! But it was not to my interest to tell you
the truth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t wonder at that,&quot; said Claude bitterly.
&quot;You were afraid of the law.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps,&quot; said Hilliston again. &quot;On the other
hand I may not be so guilty as you think me. You
will find the truth in that paper.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He pointed toward the table, and the eyes of all
immediately turned in that direction, while Hilliston
moved toward the door.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Having fulfilled the promise I made to my dead
wife, I now take my leave,&quot; he said quietly. &quot;I will
never see any of you again, and some day you may
learn that you have misjudged me. Good-by.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He opened the door, but before he could pass
through Denis sprang forward.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My sister?&quot; he said, with an indignant look in his
eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am about to repair the wrong I did her,&quot; replied
the lawyer gravely. &quot;By to-morrow she will be my
wife.&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page343" id="page343"></a>[pg&nbsp;343]</span></p>

<h2><a name="chXLIV" id="chXLIV"></a>CHAPTER XLIV.</h2>

<p class="h3">THE TRUTH.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Hilliston</span> came and went in the space of a few
minutes. None of those present made any attempt
to stay his exit, but as the door closed after him they
looked at one another in silence. Thinking of Hilliston&#39;s
last speech, Denis was the first to speak.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What does that mean, sir?&quot; he asked his master,
with an air of helpless bewilderment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think it can only mean one thing, Denis,&quot;
replied Larcher, rousing himself. &quot;Mr. Hilliston
has at length awakened to the fact of his dastardly
treatment of your sister, and is about to make reparation
for the past. He intends to marry her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But his wife only died a few days ago, master.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know that. But Mrs. Bezel will also die shortly,
and if Hilliston desires to atone for the past he has
no time to lose. He can marry her at once, but he
will again be a widower within the month.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Denis lifted a pair of shaking hands, and slowly left
the room, followed by the sympathetic looks of the
others. He did not even pause to learn the contents
of the sealed envelope left by Mr. Hilliston. Great
as was his curiosity to learn all that had taken place
on that fatal night, his love and grief for his sister
were greater still. Bowed and gray and older-looking
than ever, he departed; but in his heart there was one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page344" id="page344"></a>[pg&nbsp;344]</span>
comfortable thought&mdash;Mona would die an honest
woman, if Mr. Hilliston was to be believed.</p>

<p class="indent">When the three found themselves alone, Captain
Larcher picked up the sealed letter with some
reluctance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Strange,&quot; he said, balancing it in his hand. &quot;For
years I have been eager to know the truth. Now
that I have only to open this envelope to learn it, I
feel half afraid.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nevertheless, it will be as well to lose no time
in making ourselves acquainted with the contents,&quot;
said Tait eagerly, for he was in a fever of impatience
to know all. &quot;It may be a confession by
Hilliston.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think not. It is directed to me in the handwriting
of Mrs. Hilliston.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To Ferdinand Paynton?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No. To Captain Larcher.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;H&#39;m!&quot; said Tait, with a start. &quot;How did Mrs.
Hilliston know you were Captain Larcher? Did she
see you at Thorston?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No. But her husband doubtless informed her of
my real name. However, we will learn all from this,&quot;
said Larcher, breaking the seal. &quot;I believe this is
a confession by Mrs. Hilliston.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But what can she have to confess?&quot; cried Claude,
as his father smoothed out a closely written letter.
&quot;She can know nothing of the tragedy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You forget,&quot; said Tait, with a sudden recollection,
&quot;Louisa Sinclair; she was at Horriston, and, according
to Mona Bantry, was in the garden of The
Laurels on that night. I would not be surprised if
she saw the committal of the crime.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page345" id="page345"></a>[pg&nbsp;345]</span>
&quot;What! Do you think she is about to betray her
husband?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh,&quot; said Tait significantly, &quot;we are by no means
sure of Hilliston&#39;s guilt!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Larcher found that the writing was too small for him
to read comfortably, so handed the letter to Claude,
with a request that he should read it out aloud. Excusing
himself on the plea of the illegibility of the writing,
Claude passed it to Tait, who accepted the office with
avidity. The letter was without date or direction, and
began in an abrupt manner, highly suggestive of the
agitation under which it had been written. Tait
mentally noted these points, and began.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">&quot;This confession is to be read after my death by
Captain George Larcher, and, if he sees fit, he has my
free permission to make it public. Still I trust out of
regret for the memory of an unhappy woman that he
will not do so save in the arising of two contingencies.
First, should he be still alive, and accused of murdering
Mr. Jeringham. Second, should my dear husband
be accused of the crime. In the event of the occurrence
of either of these contingencies, I authorize him
to make these pages public.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To explain myself I must go back twenty-six years,
when I was residing at Horriston. You, Captain
Larcher, will remember me well as Louisa Sinclair, for
at that time I saw a great deal of yourself and your
wife. I saw too much of her, for my eyes were
sharp, and, but for a natural reluctance to disturb your
domestic peace, I could have enlightened you as to
her conduct. She was never worthy of a good man
like you. She was as bad as I afterward became, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page346" id="page346"></a>[pg&nbsp;346]</span>
that is saying a great deal, as you will see by
reading on.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I loved Francis Hilliston, your intimate friend.
Belinda Pike loved him also, but there was no need for
either of us to be jealous of the other, for Mr. Hilliston
loved a third person; none other than your wife. No
doubt you will be angry when you read this, but your
anger cannot alter facts. Yes, your dearest friend
loved your wife. Let him deny that if he can.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At this point there was a marginal note by Hilliston:
&quot;I do deny it, and but that I am not in a position to
do so I would not let George Larcher&#39;s eyes rest on
this confession. My poor wife was insanely jealous of
Mrs. Larcher, but I swear that she had no grounds to
be so. I admired Mrs. Larcher as a friend, nothing
more, and I loved Mona Bantry. She is the only
woman who has ever attracted me, and, notwithstanding
my marriage, now dissolved by death, she attracts
me still.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This note was hastily scribbled in pencil, and after
Tait had read it, without interruption from Captain
Larcher, he continued the confession:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I admit that I was jealous of his attentions to your
wife,&quot; continued Mrs. Hilliston, &quot;for though I did all
in my power I could not win him to my side. Regarding
the efforts of Belinda Pike, I say nothing. She
tried to gain his love, and she failed. I was more successful
in the end, but not till the lapse of many years.
Here I may say that I have gypsy blood in my veins,
which at times renders me insanely jealous, and in
such a state I am capable of all things. A recollection
of this may enlighten you as to my acting as I
did in the garden of The Laurels.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page347" id="page347"></a>[pg&nbsp;347]</span>
&quot;I knew that your wife loved Jeringham, and could
have told you of it. I am sorry I did not now, as she
would have been disgraced, and then Francis might
have turned to me for consolation. But I held my
peace, and paid the cost of doing so. I am doing so
now; you also; for if you had been forewarned you
would never have had to conceal yourself under a
feigned name on account of Jeringham&#39;s death.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;At the fancy dress ball held at the Town Hall,
matters came to a climax. My gypsy blood made me
mad on that night, owing to the way in which I was
neglected by Francis Hilliston. With some difficulty
I learned that your wife was to be dressed as Mary,
Queen of Scots, and, with a view to making myself attractive
in Hilliston&#39;s eyes, I chose the same dress.
With the assistance of the dressmaker who worked for
us both, I obtained a dress similar in all respects
to that of Mrs. Larcher, hoping that by doing so
he would speak to me under the impression that I
was your wife. My stratagem was successful. I was
masked and dressed as she was; he spoke to me,
thinking I was she, and I learned then how he loved
her. At that moment I could have killed her. I could
have killed him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Here there was another note in Hilliston&#39;s handwriting:
&quot;Again I say that the poor creature was
mistaken. I did speak to her under the impression
that she was Mrs. Larcher, but I said nothing that she
could construe into a declaration of love. Her jealousy
rendered her mad, and she distorted the idle words
I spoke. She took them up in the wrong sense.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My suspicions were confirmed later on,&quot; continued
the confession, &quot;for I overheard them talking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page348" id="page348"></a>[pg&nbsp;348]</span>
together; yes, Francis Hilliston and your wife were in
a corner together, talking of love. I listened. It was
mean to do so; but then, I was in love and would
have stooped to any degradation to have rescued him
from her clutches. They talked about a dagger which
he had given her to complete her dress. Aha! he did
not think to complete my costume with such a gift.
Mrs. Larcher took the dagger out of its sheath and
together they examined it. She blamed him for
putting an inscription on it, saying it would make her
husband jealous. Francis laughed, and said that you
would never suspect him. Then Mrs. Larcher slipped
the dagger back in the sheath, as she thought; but in
reality it slipped down among the folds of her dress,
and when she arose to go it fell on the ground. They
departed, and I picked up the dagger.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;At once I looked at the inscription, and there it
was on the gold handle&mdash;&#39;To J. L., from F. H.&#39; I
was so enraged that I could have broken the dagger.
I tried to, but it was too strong for me. Therefore
I thrust it into my waistband and went in search of
Hilliston to return it to him, and reproach him for
giving it to Mrs. Larcher. I saw him, wrapped in his
cloak, go out with Mrs. Larcher. He was seeing her
home, and in a frenzy of jealous rage I resolved to
follow.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Margin note by Hilliston: &quot;It was not I who went
home with Mrs. Larcher, but Jeringham. I was
dressed that evening as a Venetian senator, and wore
a long black cloak. This Jeringham borrowed from me
to conceal his fancy dress when he left the Town Hall.
My wife thought it was me, but she was mistaken. I
went home with George Larcher, as he knows.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page349" id="page349"></a>[pg&nbsp;349]</span>
The confession continues: &quot;They left in Mrs.
Larcher&#39;s carriage, and I, hastily wrapping a cloak
round me, followed in a fly. When I got to The
Laurels they were talking together at the door, and
the carriage had driven round to the stables. I sat
back in my fly, for the driver did not know who I was,
and watched. I saw Mrs. Larcher kiss Hilliston and
run inside. Then I went out of my mind&mdash;I was possessed
by a devil. He came down the path and turned
midway to look back at the house. I had my hand
on the dagger&mdash;it tempted me, and I sprang out on
him. He turned sharply round, and had I not been
blinded with rage I would have then recognized him.
But I hardly knew what I was doing, and, before he
could utter a word, I buried the dagger in his heart,
when he fell with a choking cry. I knelt down beside
him, and withdrew the dagger. Then I heard a sound,
dropped the weapon, and fled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Some little distance off I ran into the arms of
Francis Hilliston. I shrieked as though I had seen a
ghost, and told him I had killed a man&mdash;that I had
intended to kill him. He explained the mistake of the
cloak, and said I must have murdered Jeringham.
Then he saved my life. No one had seen me come to
The Laurels, no one had seen me in the garden; so
Francis took me back to Horriston, and I returned to
the ball without anyone having suspected my absence.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The next day the news of the disappearance of
Jeringham was all over the town; afterward the body
was discovered down the river, and mistaken for that
of Mr. Larcher. Francis advised me for my own sake
to hold my tongue. I did so, and shortly afterward I
went on a visit to a sister of mine in America. Francis
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page350" id="page350"></a>[pg&nbsp;350]</span>
refused to marry me on account of my crime. In
America I married Derrick, the millionaire; he died,
and I returned to London. I found Francis greatly in
want of money, and as I still loved him, I married him.
No one but us two knew who really killed Jeringham,
but for your sake, Captain Larcher, I acknowledge my
guilt lest you should be found out and accused of the
crime. I could say much more, but this is enough.
When you read this I will be dead, and my last words
I swear are true. I and none other killed Mark Jeringham
in mistake for Francis Hilliston.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Note by Hilliston: &quot;It will be seen that my wife
was actuated all through by jealousy, but I swear she
had no reason. I loved Mona, not Mrs. Larcher, nor
her. I saved her life because she committed the crime
for my sake; I married her because I was on the verge
of pecuniary ruin. I have nothing more to add. You
can blame me if you like, but I consider I have acted
all through as I was forced by circumstances.&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="chXLV" id="chXLV"></a>CHAPTER XLV.</h2>

<p class="h3">A FEW WORDS BY SPENSER TAIT.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">When</span> the case has been stated, when the witnesses
for and against have given their evidence, when the
counsel on both sides have delivered their speeches, it
is then customary for the judge to sum up the entire
matter for the direction of the jury. In this instance
I am the judge, and here is the Larcher affair summed
up for the understanding of the public. It has fallen
to my share to wind up the story, so here I set down
such results as happened from the confession of Mrs.
Hilliston.</p>

<p class="indent">The immediate result of her death was the marriage
of the widower to Mrs. Bezel, which took place, so to
speak, when the latter was on her deathbed. She
lingered out another two months, and died in the arms
of her husband, at peace with all the world. Denis
heartily forgave her, and the only bitter drop in her
cup was the absence of her child. Yet when Captain
Larcher suggested that Jenny should be told the truth,
and brought to say good-by to her mother, Mrs. Bezel,
with a self-denial for which I hardly gave her credit,
refused to permit such a thing. She thought that
Jenny would be happier if she was ignorant of the
truth, and moreover, Mrs. Bezel shrank from letting
her child know how she had lived during these many
years. At all events Jenny never learned the truth,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page352" id="page352"></a>[pg&nbsp;352]</span>
and Mrs. Bezel died without seeing her daughter.
That she forgave Hilliston for having deprived her of
the child is, I think, a proof of her goodness of heart,
for there is no doubt that he acted selfishly and cruelly
in doing so. But enough of Mrs. Bezel, her faults
and virtues. She lies in Hampstead Cemetery under
a plain stone of rose-colored granite, inscribed &quot;To
the memory of Mona Hilliston.&quot; So she had her wish
at last, and died an honest woman.</p>

<p class="indent">Captain Larcher returned with Kerry to the cottage
in Nightingale Lane, as he could not make up his mind
to resume his own name, or tear himself away from
the bookworm life of twenty-five years. No one knew
the truth save Claude, Jenny, and myself, for Hilliston
being absent from England does not count. The
vicar was also enlightened on the subject, and expressed
much astonishment at the strange series of
events which had culminated in the death and confession
of Mrs. Hilliston. Unwilling to lose his old
crony he heartily approved of Larcher&#39;s determination
to resume his usual life, and so the matter was settled.
Captain Larcher will remain Mr. Ferdinand Paynton
to the end of his days, and will still be a mystery to
the gossips of Thorston; how great a one they can
never guess.</p>

<p class="indent">But a notable change has taken place in his habits.
He is no longer a recluse, a misanthrope. When I am
at the Manor House he visits me there; he is a constant
guest at the vicarage, and may be seen frequently
fishing beside Kerry on the banks of the Lax. Following
the example of his master, Denis Bantry also
renounced his name, which he superstitiously regarded
as one of ill-omen, and called himself Kerry for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page353" id="page353"></a>[pg&nbsp;353]</span>
rest of his life. If he was grieved for his unhappy
sister, her life and her death, he finds consolation in
the society of Mrs. Claude Larcher, who conducts herself
toward him as a niece should do. But the relationship
is not known beyond the walls of Rose Cottage,
lest it might lead to inquiries, and Jenny is still known
as the daughter of Mr. Paynton.</p>

<p class="indent">That Claude should call Mr. Paynton &quot;father&quot; is of
course only regarded as natural by the village. Has
he not married Jenny, and does he not stand in the
relation of a son to the old man? Thorston gossips
think he is a most perfect son-in-law, and never guess
that any nearer relationship exists between them.</p>

<p class="indent">Of course Jenny and Claude were married as speedily
as possible, and I do not know a happier couple. Mrs.
Larcher has quite converted me with regard to the fair
sex, and plumes herself on her victory. She has the
audacity to say that she will yet succeed in getting me
married, but I think that is beyond her powers. Mr.
Linton married them, and they spent their honeymoon
at the Manor House, which I lent them for the occasion.
Indeed, while at Thorston they invariably live with
me, and I should be offended did they take up their
quarters anywhere else. Not that they have any desire
to do so, for Rose Cottage is rather small, and, besides,
the Manor is within easy distance of it, so that Jenny
can see her father&mdash;or, rather, her father-in-law&mdash;as
often as she chooses.</p>

<p class="indent">Claude still goes to different parts of the world to
build bridges and construct railways. Sometimes his
wife goes with him, but she does not like to be so long
away from Thorston. Paynton is now an old man,
and cannot live long, so Mrs. Larcher wishes to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page354" id="page354"></a>[pg&nbsp;354]</span>
near him as much as possible. Besides, the cares of
the nursery take up her attention, so I think that in a
few months Claude will settle down to business in
London, and make his home at Thorston, as he always
intended to do. There is a pleasant little place not
far from the Manor which I have been commissioned
to buy for him, so I really think that next year Claude
and Jenny will take up their residence among us.</p>

<p class="indent">The only person who disapproved of the marriage
was Frank Linton, who accused Jenny of jilting him.
This was utter nonsense, as she never had any intention
of becoming his wife. However, the author considers
himself badly treated, and has taken up his
quarters in London, where he writes books, and poses
in Chelsea circles. But I do not think he will ever
write so excellent a book as &quot;A Whim of Fate,&quot; perhaps
because Mrs. Claude Larcher refuses to tell him
any more plots. She has a good reason for so doing,
as the troubles which arose out of her finding the
murder papers in the garret of Rose Cottage have
startled her in no small degree. Still, as I tell her,
she must look on such troubles as a blessing in disguise,
for, after all, they led to her marriage and
present happiness. But Mrs. Claude does not see the
matter in so amiable a light.</p>

<p class="indent">Finally, Hilliston! It is hard to say what has become
of that gentleman. After the death of his
second wife, he withdrew from business and went
abroad. There I believe he is still, and from what I
hear of him at odd times he seems to have developed
into a kind of Wandering Jew. France, Italy,
Austria, Germany, Russia, he has seen all these places,
and is constantly traveling about, no doubt trying to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page355" id="page355"></a>[pg&nbsp;355]</span>
live down the past. Whether he will succeed in doing
so it is hard to say.</p>

<p class="indent">After some consideration I have come to the conclusion
that we have been rather hard on Hilliston.
He did not love Mrs. Larcher, in spite of his wife&#39;s
insane jealousy on the point, and I believe he was sincerely
attached to Mona Bantry. The blot on his
character is that he did not marry her when she first
came to London, and seeing that he was in love with
her, I profess my inability to explain why he did not
do so. Perhaps it was on account of her low birth, or
the circumstances which connected her with Jeringham,
but at all events he did not marry her till it was
too late for the poor creature&#39;s happiness. Otherwise
I do not see how he could have acted differently.
Louisa Sinclair was guilty of the murder, but as she
did it on his account, and was wildly in love with him,
it was to his honor that he protected her as he did.
Whether he would have told the truth had Mrs.
Larcher been convicted I do not know, but as Louisa
Sinclair did not leave for America till Mrs. Larcher
was released, I think Hilliston would have persuaded
her to confess openly in the event of a conviction.</p>

<p class="indent">It is true that he married her for her money, but I
think he was touched by her devotion, and gave her
some love. No doubt it was Mrs. Hilliston&#39;s remorse
for condemning his father to lifelong seclusion that
made her so kind to Claude when he was a lad. Now
it is easy to see why Hilliston was reluctant that
Claude and I should investigate the case. He was
afraid lest the truth should be found out, and his wife
arrested. I was wrong in my surmise. Hilliston was
not afraid for himself, but for the unhappy woman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page356" id="page356"></a>[pg&nbsp;356]</span>
who had killed Jeringham in mistake for him. The
whole mystery would have been solved years ago had
Dicky Pental spoken out as he should have done.
But the fear of being shut up in an asylum closed his
mouth, and so the case was at a standstill for five-and-twenty
long years.</p>

<p class="indent">It was strange that Jenny, who set the ball rolling,
should have been the indirect means of avenging her
father&#39;s murder&mdash;or rather of solving the mystery
which concealed it. Had she not discovered those
papers in the garret, she would not have been able to
give Frank Linton the plot of &quot;A Whim of Fate.&quot;
Had that novel not been written and published, Mrs.
Bezel would not have read it, and thereby have been
induced to write to Claude. Had she not done so,
Hilliston would not have told Claude the truth, thence
we would not have taken up the investigation and
solved the mystery. It was Jenny who was responsible
for the whole. After five-and-twenty years the
child of the murdered man unconsciously enlightened
us as to the person who had slain him. Fate works in
strange ways.</p>

<p class="indent">But I do not wish to figure further as a detective.
This one experience has been quite enough for me.
The thought, the anguish, the trouble is too worrying.
The next criminal case in the Larcher family can look
after itself. I abandon the rôle of detective, and thus
put the last word to my only criminal case.</p>
